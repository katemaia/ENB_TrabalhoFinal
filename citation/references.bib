Latitudinal trends in the interactions between species have, in contrast, hardly been studied at all, probably because recording interactions is much less straightforward than counting species. We have assembled two independent data sets which suggest that plant-pollinator interactions are not more ecologically specialised in the tropics compared to temperate latitudes. This is in contrast to a prevailing view that tropical ecological interactions tend towards higher specificity than their temperate counterparts.},

Although the data were subject to a large variation, it could be concluded that many edible insects provide satisfactorily with energy and protein, meet amino acid requirements for humans, are high in MUFA and/or PUFA, and rich in several micronutrients such as copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorous, selenium, and zinc as well as riboflavin, pantothenic acid, biotin, and in some cases folic acid. Liabilities of entomophagy include the possible content of allergenic and toxic substances as well as antinutrients and the presence of pathogens. More data are required for a thorough assessment of the nutritional potential of edible insects and proper processing and decontamination methods have to be developed to ensure food safety.},

Five densities of beetle populations were created on each plant genotype. Each combination of density and genotype was replicated four times, yielding 80 experimental beetle populations. Populations were initiated by releasing adult beetles into 2.25 m2 cages filled with soybeans and located in a small soybean field. Beetle populations were censused weekly for one generation. Recruitment curves for beetle populations on each soybean genotype were plotted by fitting a Ricker model to the data using likelihood methods. The recruitment curves for all genotypes were significantly different from the curves for all other genotypes. The equilibrium beetle density predicted from the curves varied among genotypes by nearly twofold, and the predicted dynamics were fluctuating for all genotypes, with the period of fluctuations differing among genotypes. Performance of beetles also differed among genotypes, suggesting that these genotypes vary in some aspect of their quality as hosts for the beetles. These results indicate that differences in quality among genotypes have the potential to affect long-term herbivore dynamics.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-wide effects of introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and native river galaxias (Galaxias eldoni McDowall) were studied by analysing ecosystem production budgets for two adjacent tributaries of a grassland stream-system in the South Island of New Zealand. One tributary was inhabited by brown trout, the other by river galaxias. No other fish species were present in either stream. The budget for the river galaxias stream indicated little top-down control of invertebrates by fish predation (river galaxias consumed ∼18\% of available prey production). A large proportion of annual net primary production was required to support production by invertebrates (invertebrates consumed an average of ∼75\% of available primary production), and mean surplus primary production (i.e. not consumed) was not significantly different from zero. Primary and secondary production were presumably mutually limiting in this system (i.e. controlled by simultaneous top-down and bottom-up mechanisms). In contrast, the budget for the brown trout stream indicated extreme top-down control of invertebrate populations by fish predation; essentially all invertebrate production (∼100\%) was required to support trout production. Invertebrate production required only a minor portion of annual net primary production (∼21\%) and primary production was presumably controlled by mechanisms other than grazing (e.g. sloughing, nutrient limitation). Predatory invertebrates had little quantitative effect on prey populations in either stream. Recent experimental studies of invertebrate behaviour, fish behaviour, and food-web structure in New Zealand streams with physically stable channels indicate that a trophic cascade should be observed in streams inhabited by brown trout, in contrast to those inhabited by native fish. The results reported here provide ecosystem-level evidence supporting this prediction.},

	abstract = {It has often been argued that conserving biodiversity is necessary for maintaining ecosystem functioning. We critically evaluate the current evidence for this argument. Although there is substantial evidence that diversity is able to affect function, particularly for plant communities, it is unclear if these patterns will hold for realistic scenarios of extinctions, multitrophic communities, or larger spatial scales. Experiments are conducted at small spatial scales, the very scales at which diversity tends to increase owing to exotics. Stressors may affect function by many pathways, and diversity-mediated effects on function may be a minor pathway, except in the case of multiple-stressor insurance effects. In general, the conservation case is stronger for stability measures of function than stock and flux measures, in part because it is easier to attribute value unambiguously to stability and in part because stock and flux measures of functions are anticipated to be more affected by multitrophic dynamics. Nor is biodiversity-ecosystem function theory likely to help conservation managers in practical decisions, except in the particular case of restoration. We give recommendations for increasing the relevance of this area of research for conservation.},

	abstract = {Plant biodiversity is being lost at a rapid rate. This has spurred much interest in elucidating the consequences of this loss for higher trophic levels. Experimental tests have shown that both plant species diversity and genetic diversity within a plant species can influence arthropod community structure. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in separate systems, so their relative importance is currently unresolved. Furthermore, potential interactions between the two levels of diversity, which likely occur in natural systems, have not been investigated. To clarify these issues, we conducted three experiments in a freshwater sand dune ecosystem. We (1) independently manipulated plant species diversity, (2) independently manipulated genetic diversity within the dominant plant species, Ammophila breviligulata, and (3) jointly manipulated genetic diversity within the dominant plant and species diversity. We found that genetic diversity within the dominant plant species, Ammophila breviligulata, more strongly influenced arthropod communities than plant species diversity, but this effect was dependent on the presence of other species. In species mixtures, A. breviligulata genetic diversity altered overall arthropod community composition, and arthropod richness and abundance peaked at the highest level of genetic diversity. Positive nonadditive effects of diversity were detected, suggesting that arthropods respond to emergent properties of diverse plant communities. However, in the independent manipulations where A. breviligulata was alone, effects of genetic diversity were weaker, with only arthropod richness responding. In contrast, plant species diversity only influenced arthropods when A. breviligulata was absent, and then only influenced herbivore abundance. In addition to showing that genetic diversity within a dominant plant species can have large effects on arthropod community composition, these results suggest that understanding how species diversity and genetic diversity interact to influence community structure may be critically important for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Recently, plant–pollinator networks have been found to be highly structured in a nested pattern in which specialists interact with generalist species. This structure is often assumed to be particular to mutualistic interactions in opposition to the compartmentalized pattern expected for antagonistic networks. We investigated the presence of asymmetric specialization in a data set assembled from the literature of 20 highly resolved plant–insect herbivore networks and compared them with 24 plant–pollinator networks. Our results indicate that these two types of networks differ, but not in the way it is generally assumed. Asymmetric specialization is present in plant–herbivore networks even if it appears less frequently than in plant–pollinator networks. Indeed, mean and median percentages of species showing asymmetric specialisation in herbivory webs are 33\% and 14\% respectively, compared to 57\% and 60\% in pollination webs. Furthermore, the amount of asymmetry is linked with species diversity and not to connectance in plant-pollinator networks whereas the opposite pattern is found in plant–herbivore networks. Our results offer promising perspectives for understanding both the mechanisms that structure ecological communities and their impact on community dynamics depending on the type of interaction.},

Yet accurate predictions of community susceptibility to invasion remain elusive. The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion, is supported by both theory and experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales. Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies, we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods. Both the establishment (number of invaders) and success (proportion of invaders that are large) of invading plants are reduced. These results suggest that local biodiversity represents an important line of defence against the spread of invaders.},

	abstract = {Assessments of restoration are usually made through vegetation community surveys, leaving much of the ecosystem underexamined. Invertebrates, and ants in particular, are good candidates for restoration evaluation because they are sensitive to environmental change and are particularly important in ecosystem functioning. The considerable resources currently employed in restoring calcareous grassland on ex-arable land mean that it is important to gather as much information as possible on how ecosystems change through restoration. We compared ant communities from 40 ex-arable sites where some form of restoration work had been implemented between 2 and 60 years previously, with 40 paired reference sites of good quality calcareous grassland with no history of improvement or cultivation. A total of 11 ant species were found, but only two of these were found to be significantly different in abundance between restoration and reference sites: Myrmica sabuleti was more likely to be present in reference sites, whereas Lasius niger was more likely to be found in restoration sites. Myrmica sabuleti abundance was significantly positively correlated with age of restoration sites. The potential number of ant species found in temperate grasslands is small, limiting the information their assemblages can provide about ecosystem change. However, M. sabuleti is a good indicator species for calcareous grassland restoration success and, alongside information from the plant community, could increase the confidence with which restoration success is judged. We found the survey to be quick and simple to carry out and recommend its use.},

We propose here a procedure for predicting the trajectory of species recovery and for specifying the priority of habitat types for restoration of a rural agricultural landscape. We then apply it as a case study to the recovery of dragonfly species in the Azame restoration project that began in 2003 in northern Kyushu, Japan. We examined the nestedness of the regional distribution of dragonflies using a national database on wildlife distribution and listed the recorded species in order of their prevalence in the region. We also conducted a census of adult dragonflies currently found at the restoration site to assess species richness. By comparing these data, we identified species potentially capable of inhabiting the restoration site and, based on their habitat requirements, suggest what type of habitat (e.g., bogs and marshes, ponds, and bodies of slow-moving water) should be restored preferentially. We observed significant nestedness in the presence–absence matrix for dragonfly species and thus predict that species recovery at the restoration site will follow the regional order of prevalence of the species. The required habitat types did not differ significantly between the currently observed species and the potential species, which indicates that all these habitat types should be restored in the project.},

	abstract = {Loss of species caused by widespread stressors, such as drought and fragmentation, is likely to be non-random depending on species abundance in the community. We experimentally reduced the number of rare and uncommon plant species while independently reducing only the abundance of dominant grass species in intact, native grassland. This allowed us to simulate a non-random pattern of species loss, based on species abundances, from communities shaped by natural ecological interactions and characterized by uneven species abundance distributions. Over two growing seasons, total above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) declined with reductions in abundance of the dominant species but was unaffected by a threefold decline in richness of less common species. In contrast, productivity of the remaining rare and uncommon species decreased with declining richness, in part due to loss of complementary interactions among these species. However, increased production of the dominant grasses offset the negative effects of species loss. We conclude that the dominant species, as controllers of ecosystem function, can provide short-term resistance to reductions in ecosystem function when species loss is nonrandom. However, the concurrent loss of complementary interactions among rare and uncommon species, the most diverse component of communities, may contribute to additional species loss and portends erosion of ecosystem function in the long term.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.
INTRODUCTION A surprisingly general pattern at very large scales casts light on the link between ecosystem structure and function. We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near ¾, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.
RATIONALE We assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.
RESULTS Across ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near ¾ exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (R2 {\textgreater} 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near ¾ body-mass allometries.
CONCLUSION Systematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near ¾ exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life.

A general scaling law for ecology
Despite the huge diversity of ecological communities, they can have unexpected patterns in common. Hatton et al. describe a general scaling law that relates total predator and prey biomass in terrestrial and aquatic animal communities (see the Perspective by Cebrian). They draw on data from many thousands of population counts of animal communities ranging from plankton to large mammals, across a wide range of biomes. They find a ubiquitous pattern of biomass scaling, which may suggest an underlying organization in ecosystems. It seems that communities follow systematic changes in structure and dynamics across environmental gradients.

	abstract = {Currently, a large-scale restoration project aims to restore around 15 million hectares of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. This will increase forest cover and connectivity among remnant sites as well as restore environmental services. Currently, studies on recovery of fauna in restored areas of the Atlantic Forest are practically nonexistent. To address this knowledge vacuum, our study compares diversity patterns of fruit-feeding butterflies in three forest areas with different restoration ages (11, 22, and 54 years), and uses a native forest area as reference. Results showed butterfly communities in maturing restored areas becoming more similar to the ones found in the native forest, with an increase in the proportional abundance of forest species, and a decrease of edge and grassland species. Moreover, we found a higher diversity among sites at the intermediate restoration age, with a community composed of both grassland and forest species. Butterfly species composition differed significantly among sites, showing interesting patterns of potential species replacement over time. Our results indicate that, although restored sites were located in a fragmented landscape, they provide suitable habitats for recolonization by fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages. Hence, restored areas can be considered important habitat for forest animal species, increasing local biodiversity and, possibly, restoring some of the ecosystem services provided by them.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are a threat to the maintenance of ecological processes, including pollination. Plant-flower visitor networks are traditionally used as a surrogated for pollination at the community level, despite they do not represent the pollination process, which takes place at the stigma of plants where pollen grains are deposited. Here we investigated whether the invasion of the alien plant Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) affects pollen transfer at the community level. We asked whether more alien pollen is deposited on the stigmas of plants on invaded sites, whether deposition is affected by stigma type (dry, semidry and wet) and whether the invasion of I. glandulifera changes the structure of the resulting pollen transfer networks. We sampled stigmas of plants on 10 sites invaded by I. glandulifera (hereafter, balsam) and 10 non-invaded control sites. All 20 networks had interactions with balsam pollen, although significantly more balsam pollen was found on plants with dry stigmas in invaded areas. Balsam pollen deposition was restricted to a small subset of plant species, which is surprising because pollinators are known to carry high loads of balsam pollen. Balsam invasion did not affect the loading of native pollen, nor did it affect pollen transfer network properties; networks were modular and poorly nested, both of which are likely to be related to the specificity of pollen transfer interactions. Our results indicate that pollination networks become more specialized when moving from the flower visitation to the level of pollen transfer networks. Therefore, caution is needed when inferring pollination from patterns of insect visitation or insect pollen loads as the relationship between these and pollen deposition is not straightforward.},

Typically, models based on network topology are used to simulate coextinctions in mutualistic networks. However, such topological models neglect two key biological features of species interactions: variation in the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism, and variation in the relative importance of each interacting partner. By incorporating both types of variation, we developed a stochastic coextinction model capable of simulating extinction cascades far more complex than those observed in previous topological models. Using a set of empirical mutualistic networks, we show that the traditional topological model may either underestimate or overestimate the number and likelihood of coextinctions, depending on the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism. More importantly, contrary to topological models, our stochastic model predicts extinction cascades to be more likely in highly connected mutualistic communities.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT One of the most common explanations for an increase in species richness with productivity is what we have dubbed the “More Individuals Hypothesis.” According to this hypothesis, more productive sites can support higher total abundances and, since species richness is an increasing function of total abundance, so will it be of productivity. This hypothesis assumes that communities are limited by productivity. We tested the More Individuals Hypothesis using the detritivorous aquatic insect communities of tree holes. When tree holes with varying levels of productivity (debris amount) were allowed to be colonized (through oviposition), more productive tree holes did have more species but not more individuals. Neither was total energy use strictly proportional to productivity. Only in communities forced to disassemble through productivity reductions were the predictions of the More Individuals Hypothesis satisfied. Ovipositing adults may prefer productive tree holes not because they contain more resources but because they are anticipated to be less likely to dry out. In tree holes, and more generally, the More Individuals Hypothesis is an insufficient explanation for increases in species richness with productivity because it neither accounts for the different processes of local coloni zation and extinction nor allows body size to correlate with extinction risk.},

Unlike recent surveys of the tritrophic literature we do not seek to quantify whether top-down or bottom-up forces predominate in any given set of experimental systems. Acknowledging the dearth of empirical synthesis we employ two contrasting literature surveys to determine whether the plant–insect herbivore–natural enemy literature is currently adequate to form a conceptual synthesis of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces.  The emergence of a synthesis of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in plant–insect herbivore–natural enemy systems appears to have been largely prevented by (1) the absence of appropriate empirical data; (2) failure to appreciate the merits of existing data; (3) a continued desire to emphasise either top-down or bottom-up forces to the exclusion of the other; and (4) confusion regarding which processes regulate and which influence the abundance of insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {There is a strong trend of declining populations in many species of both animals and plants. Dwindling numbers of species can eventually lead to their functional extinction. Functional, or ecological, extinction occurs when a species becomes too rare to fulfill its ecological, interactive role in the ecosystem, leading to true (numerical) extinction of other depending species. Recent theoretical work on food webs suggests that the frequency of functional extinction might be surprisingly high. However, little is known about the risk of functional species extinctions in networks with other types of interactions than trophic ones. Here, we explore the frequency of functional extinctions in model ecological networks having different proportions of antagonistic and mutualistic links. Furthermore, we investigate the topological relationship between functionally and numerically extinct species. We find that (1) the frequency of functional extinctions is higher in networks containing a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions than in networks with only one type of interaction, (2) increased mortality rate of species having both mutualistic and antagonistic links is more likely to lead to extinction of another species than to extinction of the species itself compared to species having only mutualistic or antagonistic links, and (3) trophic distance (shortest path) between functionally and numerically extinct species is, on average, longer than one, indicating the importance of indirect effects. These results generalize the findings of an earlier study on food webs, demonstrating the potential importance of functional extinction in a variety of ecological network types.},

Yet, the peer-review system is poorly adapted to recent changes in the discipline and current societal needs. We provide historical context for the cultural lag that governs peer review that has eventually led to the system's current structural weaknesses (voluntary review, unstandardized review criteria, decentralized process). We argue that some current attempts to upgrade or otherwise modify the peer-review system are merely sticking-plaster solutions to these fundamental flaws, and therefore are unlikely to resolve them in the long term. We claim that for peer review to be relevant, effective, and contemporary with today's publishing demands across scientific disciplines, its main components need to be redesigned. We propose directional changes that are likely to improve the quality, rigour, and timeliness of peer review, and thereby ensure that this critical process serves the community it was created for.},

Constancy was tested on three levels. Within a single trip, 88\% of the samples examined comprised pure pollen loads (97\% or more of one pollen type). Within a single day, 88\% of bees visited the same species across trips sampled. Across 2 and 3 days, 82\% and 73\%, respectively, of individual bees foraged on a single pollen type. The majority of the remaining bees collected only two species of pollen. This pattern is consistent with that of other highly social bees. It enhances the pollinator efficacy of these insects by increasing the chances of pollen being transferred to stigmas of the same plant species. This increases the ecological importance of these bees and their value in crop pollination.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest restoration is becoming increasingly more applied to offset biodiversity loss and maintain ecosystem processes, but knowledge about its efficacy is still limited. We evaluated the success of tropical forest active restoration using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) as bioindicators and combining measures of species diversity, composition and functional diversity. We assessed patterns of dung beetles community assembly along a restoration chronosequence and also compared restoration areas with reference (primary and old secondary forest) and degraded (pasture) ecosystems. Species composition in the restoration areas was clearly progressing towards the preserved forests and deviating from the pasture with increasing restoration age. We also found a turnover of open environment specialists and habitat generalists to forest generalists and forest specialist species along the restoration chronosequence. However, the majority of individuals in the older restored habitats were typically forest generalists. Biomass was the only variable that increased with restoration age. Species richness, number of individuals, biomass and functional richness in the restored areas were similar to, or even smaller, than in pastures and substantially lower than forest reference sites. Rarefied richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion did not vary between the habitats. We found that while restored areas have the capacity to host forest-restricted species, 18 years since active restoration has not been long enough to recover a stable and diverse dung beetle assemblage. Our study also demonstrates that measures of composition, species diversity and functional diversity can complement each other and contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy of restoration practices.},

However, the impacts of this disturbance on tropical forests remain mostly unknown. We investigate the impacts of forest fires on community parameters and biomass of dung beetles, a cost-effective indicator of disturbance and overall biodiversity, in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Our results indicate that burned forests harbor a modified dung beetle community, with altered abundance, community composition, and structure. Burned forest samples had lower total biomass and were dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. Large-bodied tunneler species were negatively impacted, responding to changes in environmental characteristics such as soil compaction. Lower biomass and higher predominance of smaller species in burned forest is likely to impact dung beetle-mediated ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. Our results support that forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon pose a serious threat to local biodiversity and habitat integrity.},

To determine whether evolutionary trade-offs among plant traits influence patterns of trophic control, we manipulated predators and soil fertility and measured impacts of a major herbivore (the aphid Aphis nerii) on 16 milkweed species (Asclepias spp.) in a phylogenetic field experiment. Herbivore density was determined by variation in predation and trade-offs between herbivore resistance and plant growth strategy. Neither herbivore density nor predator effects on herbivores predicted the cascading effects of predators on plant biomass. Instead, cascade strength was strongly and positively associated with milkweed response to soil fertility. Accordingly, contemporary patterns of trophic control are driven by evolutionary convergent trade-offs faced by plants.},

	abstract = {Two decades of intensive research have provided compelling evidence for a link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (B-EF). Whereas early B-EF research concentrated on species richness and single processes, recent studies have investigated different measures of both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, such as functional diversity and joint metrics of multiple processes. There is also a shift from viewing assemblages in terms of their contribution to particular processes toward placing them within a wider food web context. We review how the responses and predictors in B-EF experiments are quantified and how biodiversity effects are shaped by multitrophic interactions. Further, we discuss how B-EF metrics and food web relations could be addressed simultaneously. We conclude that addressing traits, multiple processes and food web interactions is needed to capture the mechanisms that underlie B-EF relations in natural assemblages.},

	abstract = {Food webs may be affected by evolutionary processes, and effective evolutionary time ultimately affects the probability of species evolving to fill the niche space. Thus, ecosystem history may set important evolutionary constraints on community composition and food web structure. Food chain length (FCL) has long been recognized as a fundamental ecosystem attribute. We examined historical effects on FCL in large lakes spanning {\textgreater}6 orders of magnitude in age. We found that food chains in the world’s ancient lakes (n = 8) were significantly shorter than in recently formed lakes (n = 10) and reservoirs (n = 3), despite the fact that ancient lakes harbored much higher species richness, including many endemic species. One potential factor leading to shorter FCL in ancient lakes is an increasing diversity of trophic omnivores and herbivores. Speciation could simply broaden the number of species within a trophic group, particularly at lower trophic levels and could also lead to a greater degree of trophic omnivory. Our results highlight a counter-intuitive and poorly-understood role of evolutionary history in shaping key food web properties such as FCL.},

The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

As predators tend to be larger than their prey, food-chains are size-structured: animal size increases with trophic position. We found a negative correlation between the size of the primary consumer and the length of the chain. Food-chains based on small primary consumers are longer than those based on large primary consumers, and size rather than energetic efficiency is the main contributing factor. We found no correlation between habitat productivity and mean food-chain length. All these findings support the SLH over the ELH. Our results suggest that, as in aquatic communities, a single factor—a predator/prey size-ratio greater than 1—governs the structure of terrestrial communities.},

	abstract = {1. The view of post-mining sites is rapidly changing among ecologists and conservationists, as sensitive restoration using spontaneous succession may turn such sites into biodiversity refuges in human-exploited regions. However, technical reclamation, consisting of covering the sites by topsoil, sowing fast-growing herb mixtures and planting trees, is still commonly adopted. Until now, no multi-taxa study has compared technically reclaimed sites and sites left with spontaneous succession. 2. We sampled communities of vascular plants and 10 arthropod groups in technically reclaimed and spontaneously restored plots in limestone quarries in the Bohemian Karst, Czech Republic. For comparison, we used paired t-tests and multivariate methods, emphasizing red-list status and habitat specialization of individual species. 3. We recorded 692 species of target taxa, with a high proportion of red-listed (10\%) and xeric specialist (14\%) species, corroborating the great conservation potential of the quarries. 4. Spontaneously restored post-mining sites did not differ in species richness from the technical reclaimed sites but they supported more rare species. The microhabitat cover of leaf litter, herbs and moss, were all directly influenced by the addition of topsoil during reclamation. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the high conservation potential of limestone quarries could be realized by allowing succession to progress spontaneously with minimal intervention. Given the threat to semi-natural sparsely vegetated habitats in many regions, active restoration measures at post-mining sites should be limited to maintenance of early successional stages, instead of acceleration of succession.},

The argument is beguilingly simple. In the absence of a detailed understanding of what each species does in an ecosystem, it would be foolish to allow the loss of any one of them. It is the precautionary principle writ large and, given its enormous ramifications for the ways in which people interact with the natural world, ecologists have spent much intellectual energy, time, and resources in determining whether it has a strong empirical basis (2). Indeed, some of the best-known recent ecological experiments have examined the consequences of varying the numbers of species in a small area on ecosystem function. This focus assumes that the importance of retaining Leopold's cogs and wheels lies mostly in the differences between them. However, a growing body of work on common species underlines that having sufficient copies of some key pieces may be equally, and perhaps often more, important.},

We classified the parasitoids of 185 British herbivorous insect species as being koinobionts (which should tend to be specialists) or idiobionts (potential generalists) to examine the influences of host feeding-niche and foodplant type on the numbers of parasitoid species attacking individual host species. 2. The majority of parasitoid species of exophytic hosts are koinobionts, whereas endophytic hosts support mainly idiobionts. 3. Parasitoid assemblage size increases with host foodplant size and complexity; for endophytic hosts this is due to an increase in idiobionts on hosts on large plants, but for exophytic hosts it is the number of koinobionts that increases with foodplant size. 4. Comparison of these patterns with those predicted under a competition hypothesis suggests that parasitoid communities associated with endophytic hosts may be commonly limited by interspecific competition, whereas those of exophytic hosts probably are not.},

	abstract = {* 1There are few studies of the performance of species in restored vegetation communities. Here we report the results of a meta-analysis of 25 experiments concerned with species-rich grassland restoration on ex-arable land and agriculturally improved grasslands situated at a wide range of locations throughout lowland Britain. Differences in species’ performance were related to 38 physiological and morphological traits.
* 2An experiment-adjusted performance index was calculated for each of the 58 species (13 grasses and 45 forbs). The performance index was calculated for the first 4 years after establishment together with a temporal trend.
* 3Individual species showed large differences in performance indices. However, grasses consistently out-performed forbs.
* 4We examined the linkage between species’ performance and traits according to four non-exclusive hypotheses. The ability to establish and persist in restored vegetation communities requires: (H1) good gap colonization ability; (H2) strong competitive capability; and (H3) ability to undergo vegetative regeneration. (H4) Successful species are generalists associated with fertile habitats.
* 5Trait analyses supported all four hypotheses. Within the forbs, good establishment in the first year was linked to traits determining colonization ability: ruderality, percentage germination of seeds and autumn germination. However, traits linked to competitive ability, vegetative growth and seed bank persistence became increasingly important determinants of success with time. Species with generalist habitat requirements, and especially those associated with fertile soils, performed increasingly well with time. This reflects the development of a closed vegetation in which the ability to grow vigorously and out-compete other established plants is important.
* 6Stress-tolerators, habitat specialists and species of infertile habitats performed badly. This may reflect high residual fertility in restored grasslands and particular niche requirements of these species. This may be a problem as grassland restoration often targets communities characterized by species with these traits and many are food plants of invertebrates of conservation value.
* 7There were few significant correlations between the performance of the grasses and traits reflecting their overall good performance in comparison with the forbs.
* 8This study has important implications for practical restoration programmes and policies. Efficiency might be increased by introducing only species with good performance, but this would lead to uniformity among restored grasslands and would diminish the benefits of habitat restoration for national and regional biodiversity.
* 9Synthesis and applications. Future work should focus on practical methods to increase the successful establishment of the poor performing but desirable species, by (i) targeting restoration to low fertility soils, (ii) changing the abiotic environment or (iii) the ‘phased introduction’ of species several years after restoration, when both the plant community is more stable and the environmental conditions are more favourable for establishment.},

	abstract = {Globally, most restoration efforts focus on re-creating the physical structure (flora or physical features) of a target ecosystem with the assumption that other ecosystem components will follow. Here we investigate that assumption by documenting biogeographical patterns in an important invertebrate taxon, the parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae, in a recently reforested Hawaiian landscape. Specifically, we test the influence of (1) planting configurations (corridors versus patches), (2) vegetation age, (3) distance from mature native forest, (4) surrounding tree cover, and (5) plant community composition on ichneumonid richness, abundance, and composition. We sampled over 7,000 wasps, 96.5\% of which were not native to Hawai’i. We found greater relative richness and abundance of ichneumonids, and substantially different communities, in restored areas compared to mature forest and abandoned pasturelands. Non-native ichneumonids drive these differences; restored areas and native forest did not differ in native ichneumonid abundance. Among restored areas, ichneumonid communities did not differ by planting age or configuration. As tree cover increased within 120 m of a sampling point, ichneumonid community composition increasingly resembled that found in native forest. Similarly, native ichneumonid abundance increased with proximity to native forest. Our results suggest that restoration plantings, if situated near target forest ecosystems and in areas with higher local tree cover, can facilitate restoration of native fauna even in a highly invaded system.},

	abstract = {Restoration ecologists use reference information to define restoration goals, determine the restoration potential of sites, and evaluate the success of restoration efforts. Basic to the selection and use of reference information is the need to understand temporal and spatial variation in nature. This is a challenging task: variation is likely to be scale dependent; ecosystems vary in complex ways at several spatial and temporal scales; and there is an important interaction between spatial and temporal variation. The two most common forms of reference information are historical data from the site to be restored and contemporary data from reference sites (sites chosen as good analogs of the site to be restored). Among the problems of historical data are unmeasured factors that confound the interpretation of historical changes observed. Among the problems of individual reference sites is the difficulty of finding or proving a close match in all relevant ecological dimensions. Approximating and understanding ecological variation will require multiple sources of information. Restoration, by its inherently experimental nature, can further the understanding of the distribution, causes, and functions of nature's variation.},

The practice of ecological restoration has been identified as providing ideal experimental settings for tests of ecological theory; restoration was to be the ‘acid test’ of our ecological understanding. Over the past decade, restoration science has gained a strong academic foothold, addressing problems faced by restoration practitioners, bringing new focus to existing ecological theory and fostering a handful of novel ecological ideas. In particular, recent advances in plant community ecology have been strongly linked with issues in ecological restoration. Evolving models of succession, assembly and state-transition are at the heart of both community ecology and ecological restoration. Recent research on seed and recruitment limitation, soil processes, and diversity–function relationships also share strong links to restoration. Further opportunities may lie ahead in the ecology of plant ontogeny, and on the effects of contingency, such as year effects and priority effects. Ecology may inform current restoration practice, but there is considerable room for greater integration between academic scientists and restoration practitioners.},

Two populations of Pontania sawflies were studied in northern Arizona, USA: one at Oak Creek and one at Flagstaff. The phenology of sawfly oviposition and larval development differed dramatically between the two locations. Enemy-caused larval mortality was also significantly different for the two sites. At Oak Creek, sawfly larval survival was high, the natural enemy attack rate was low, and sawfly oviposition occurred early in the period of willow growth. Sawfly larval survival was low at Flagstaff, enemies killed a high proportion of the larvae, and oviposition occurred late in the period of willow growth. Sawflies that oviposited early at Flagstaff produced larvae with a lower probability of survival than larval in later cohorts. Sawfly natural enemies were responsible for increased Pontania mortality with earlier oviposition at Flagstaff. One mechanism that caused increased mortality was temporal synchrony with the enemies' oviposition period. The rate of mortality from abortion of sawflies or miscellaneous causes did not relate to oviposition phenology in any consistent pattern. We hypothesize that temporal variability in three-trophic-level interactions may have resulted in a phenological shift by the Flagstaff Pontania population to synchronize with @'windows of time@' that maximum survival and enemy-free space.},

This is the first study to evaluate plant-herbivore interaction networks on a small spatio-temporal scale. Specifically, we simultaneously assessed the effect of host plant availability, habitat complexity and seasonality on the structure of plant-herbivore networks in a coastal tropical ecosystem. Our results revealed that changes in the host plant community resulting from seasonality and habitat structure are reflected not only in the herbivore community, but also in the emergent properties (network parameters) of the plant-herbivore interaction network such as connectance, selectiveness and modularity. Habitat conditions and periods that are most stressful favored the presence of less selective and susceptible herbivore species, resulting in increased connectance within networks. In contrast, the high degree of selectivennes (i.e. interaction specialization) and modularity of the networks under less stressful conditions was promoted by the diversification in resource use by herbivores. By analyzing networks at a small spatio-temporal scale we identified the ecological factors structuring this network such as habitat complexity and seasonality. Our research offers new evidence on the role of abiotic and biotic factors in the variation of the properties of species interaction networks.},

However, the loss of basal species is likely to have profound impacts on the abundance, richness and ecosystem functioning of species at higher trophic levels. 2. Here, we used experimentally established plant communities with a species richness gradient to study the effects of plant species loss on a multi-trophic insect community in the field. We measured densities and species richness of aphids and parasitic wasps (primary, secondary and facultative tertiary parasitoids of aphids) that naturally colonized the grassland plots. 3. Furthermore, we calculated two ecosystem functions: aphid load (the number of aphid individuals per host plant biomass used as a proxy for herbivory) and parasitism rate. We used structural equation models to explore pathways of direct and indirect effects of plant species richness on higher trophic levels. 4. We found that the densities and richness of species at all trophic levels were influenced by changes in plant species richness. The effects were rarely direct, but instead mediated by the abundance and species richness of aphid host plants and subsequent trophic levels. 5. The herbivore and primary parasitoid levels were most directly affected by changes in plant species richness, with highest insect densities and species richness occurring at intermediate plant species richness. The densities and species richness of secondary parasitoids declined linearly with plant species richness owing to sparser resources, resulting in shorter food chains in communities with the highest plant species richness. 6. Aphid load was highest at intermediate plant species richness and negatively affected by both host plant biomass and host plant species richness. Parasitism rate was mostly affected indirectly via aphid density and overall only weakly negatively related to plant species richness. 7. Our results demonstrate that plant species richness can have strong cascading effects up to high trophic levels. However, their direction may differ at the lower and higher ends of the plant species richness spectrum, cautioning against simplifying consequences of plant species loss for specialist food webs that may become limited by sparse resources at high plant richness.},

	abstract = {* Stable coexistence of ecologically identical species is not possible according to the established ecological theory. Many coexistence mechanisms have been proposed, but they all involve some form of ecological differentiation among the competing species.


* The aggregation model of coexistence would predict coexistence of identical species if there would be a mechanism that generates spatially aggregated distributions that are not completely correlated among the species. Our aim is to demonstrate that continued dispersal, triggered by reproductive interference between ecologically identical species, is such a mechanism. This study has been motivated by species using ephemeral patchy resources, such as decomposing fruits, fungal sporophores, carrion, and dung.


* We analyse an individual-based model with sexual reproduction, in which the progeny develops in ephemeral resource patches and the new generation disperses to a new set of patches. We assume spatially restricted dispersal, that patches differ in detectability, and that unmated females continue dispersal.


* In the model, reproductive interference (males spend some time searching for and/or attempting to mate with heterospecific females) reduces the mating rate of females, especially in the less common species, which leads to increased dispersal and reduces spatial correlation in species' distributions.


* For a wide range of parameter values, coexisting species show a systematic difference in their relative abundances due to two opposing forces: (1) uncommon species have reduced growth rate (Allee effect), which decreases abundance; (2) an abundance difference between the species reduces interspecific spatial correlation, which in turn reduces interspecific competition and allows the rarer species to persist at low density.


* Our results demonstrate a new mechanism for coexistence that is not based on ecological differentiation between species.},

	abstract = {The Neolithic was marked by a transition from small and relatively egalitarian groups to much larger groups with increased stratification. But, the dynamics of this remain poorly understood. It is hard to see how despotism can arise without coercion, yet coercion could not easily have occurred in an egalitarian setting. Using a quantitative model of evolution in a patch-structured population, we demonstrate that the interaction between demographic and ecological factors can overcome this conundrum. We model the coevolution of individual preferences for hierarchy alongside the degree of despotism of leaders, and the dispersal preferences of followers. We show that voluntary leadership without coercion can evolve in small groups, when leaders help to solve coordination problems related to resource production. An example is coordinating construction of an irrigation system. Our model predicts that the transition to larger despotic groups will then occur when: (i) surplus resources lead to demographic expansion of groups, removing the viability of an acephalous niche in the same area and so locking individuals into hierarchy; (ii) high dispersal costs limit followers' ability to escape a despot. Empirical evidence suggests that these conditions were probably met, for the first time, during the subsistence intensification of the Neolithic.},

The successful execution of this collective phenomenon relies on the appropriate response of individuals in swarms to a myriad of signals that are produced by workers and queens to synchronize their nest exodus, subsequent house hunting, and eventual relocation to a new nest site. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the social factors that trigger swarming in colonies and the nonchemical and chemical signals that mediate a coordinated transition between its stages. We also highlight emerging work on the physiological and genomic mechanisms underpinning swarming behavior. Finally, we discuss the possible evolutionary origins of swarming behavior, through comparisons with related behaviors of migration, overwintering, estivation, and diapause in honey bees and other insects.},

	abstract = {There is considerable concern over declines in insect pollinator communities and potential impacts on the pollination of crops and wildflowers. Among the multiple pressures facing pollinators, decreasing floral resources due to habitat loss and degradation has been suggested as a key contributing factor. However, a lack of quantitative data has hampered testing for historical changes in floral resources. Here we show that overall floral rewards can be estimated at a national scale by combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements. We find evidence for substantial losses in nectar resources in England and Wales between the 1930s and 1970s; however, total nectar provision in Great Britain as a whole had stabilized by 1978, and increased from 1998 to 2007. These findings concur with trends in pollinator diversity, which declined in the mid-twentieth century but stabilized more recently. The diversity of nectar sources declined from 1978 to 1990 and thereafter in some habitats, with four plant species accounting for over 50\% of national nectar provision in 2007. Calcareous grassland, broadleaved woodland and neutral grassland are the habitats that produce the greatest amount of nectar per unit area from the most diverse sources, whereas arable land is the poorest with respect to amount of nectar per unit area and diversity of nectar sources. Although agri-environment schemes add resources to arable landscapes, their national contribution is low. Owing to their large area, improved grasslands could add substantially to national nectar provision if they were managed to increase floral resource provision. This national-scale assessment of floral resource provision affords new insights into the links between plant and pollinator declines, and offers considerable opportunities for conservation.},

	abstract = {Pollination systems are recognized as critical for the maintenance of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, the understanding of mechanisms that promote the integrity of those mutualistic assemblages is an important issue for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. In this study we present a new population dynamics model for plant–pollinator interactions that is based on the consumer–resource approach and incorporates a few essential features of pollination ecology. The model was used to project the temporal dynamics of three empirical pollination network, in order to analyze how adaptive foraging of pollinators (AF) shapes the outcome of community dynamics in terms of biodiversity and network robustness to species loss. We found that the incorporation of AF into the dynamics of the pollination networks increased the persistence and diversity of its constituent species, and reduced secondary extinctions of both plants and animals. These findings were best explained by the following underlying processes: 1) AF increased the amount of floral resources extracted by specialist pollinators, and 2) AF raised the visitation rates received by specialist plants. We propose that the main mechanism by which AF enhanced those processes is (trophic) niche partitioning among animals, which in turn generates (pollen vector) niche partitioning among plants. Our results suggest that pollination networks can maintain their stability and diversity by the adaptive foraging of generalist pollinators.},

However, little is known about the respective influence of the quantity and identity of associated species on herbivory in focal plants.


* Using a meta-analysis to compare insect herbivory in pure and mixed forests, we specifically tested the effects of the relative abundance of focal tree species and of phylogenetic distance between focal and associated tree species on the magnitude of associational resistance.


* Overall, insect herbivory was significantly lower in mixed forests, but the outcome varied greatly depending on the phylogenetic relatedness among tree species and the degree of herbivore feeding specialization.


* Specialist herbivore damage or abundance was positively related to relative abundance of their host trees, regardless of the phylogenetic distance between host and associated tree species.


* By contrast, tree diversity triggered associational resistance to generalist herbivores only when tree mixtures included tree species phylogenetically distant to the focal species.


* Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the establishment of mixed forests per se is not sufficient to convey associational resistance to herbivores if the identity of tree species associated in mixtures is not taken into account. As a general rule, mixing phylogenetically more distinct tree species, such as mixtures of conifers and broadleaved trees, results in more effective reduction in herbivore damage.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of plant diversity on abundance of invertebrate herbivores, parasitoids and predators in two grassland communities (one in Switzerland and one in Sweden) in which plant species richness and functional diversity have been experimentally manipulated. Among herbivores, the abundance of only the most sessile and specialised groups (leafhoppers and wingless aphids) was affected by plant diversity. At both sites, numbers of leafhoppers in sweep net samples showed a linear, negative relationship with plant species number whereas numbers of wingless aphids in suction samples increased with the number of plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, and non-legume forbs) present in the plot. Activity of carabid beetles and spiders (as revealed by pitfall catches) and the total number of predators in pitfalls at the Swiss site decreased linearly with increases in the number of plant species and plant functional groups. Abundance of more specialised enemies, hymenopteran parasitoids, was not affected by the manipulations of plant diversity. Path analysis and analysis of covariance indicated that plant diversity effects on invertebrate abundance were mostly indirect and mediated by changes in plant biomass and cover. At both sites, plant species composition (i.e. the identity of plant species in a mixture) affected numbers of most of the examined groups of invertebrates and was, therefore, a more important determinant of invertebrate abundance in grasslands than plant species richness per se or the number of plant functional groups. The presence of legumes in a mixture was especially important and led to higher numbers of most invertebrate groups. The similarity of invertebrate responses to plant diversity at the two study sites indicates that general patterns in abundance of different trophic groups can be detected across plant diversity gradients under different environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Food chain length provides insights into how ecosystems function and respond to global change. A recent synthesis has shown that food chain length is significantly related to both ecosystem productivity and ecosystem size. Relaxation of energetic constraints on top predators has been advanced as the primary mechanism explaining the importance of ecosystem productivity whereas the significance of ecosystem size may be related to the fact that larger ecosystems provide more refuge that stabilizes intermediate predators. Given that submerged macrophytes in lakes are known to enhance both ecosystem productivity and the amount of available refuge, we hypothesized that food chain lengths, measured as the trophic positions of top predators, would be significantly related to macrophyte biomass. We tested our hypothesis by conducting a field survey of shallow lakes across a strong macrophyte but limited morphometric gradient using a hierarchical mixed effect modeling approach. We determined that macrophyte biomass was positively related to the trophic position of numerous piscivores and to food chain length across lakes. Both lake volume and macrophyte biomass were retained as fixed predictors in our model with lowest AICc, and this model explained 85\% of the variation in piscivorous fish trophic positions considering both fixed and random effects (i.e., lake and species-specific responses to lake volume). Macrophyte biomass explained 29\% of the residual variation in food chain length when the effect of lake volume was removed. These results are the first to directly relate macrophyte biomass to piscivore trophic positions and food chain length. We conclude that shallow lakes with higher macrophyte biomass support longer food chains independent of ecosystem size and nutrient concentration. We suggest that loss of macrophytes largely driven by human activities reduces food chain length, with potential consequences for ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Stand diversification increasingly emerges as a promising means for improving the multi-functionality and sustainability of management in plantation forests. Increasing tree species richness might potentially also benefit natural enemies, which can substantially contribute to sustainable forest management via top-down control of forest pests. However, there is little empirical evidence on how tree species richness affects the diversity and abundance of predators, as the majority of analyses to date have rarely gone beyond comparisons of monocultures and two species mixtures. Here, we analyzed the performance of spiders as important generalist predators in a tree diversity experiment that uses four of the economically most important broadleaved and coniferous tree species in Europe. We tested the extent to which tree species richness and the identity of the planted tree species affect the abundance, biomass, species richness and functional diversity of spiders. Whereas tree species richness in general had no significant effect, tree species identity strongly affected spider biomass and abundance—with a particularly strong negative effect of the non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Our results indicate that increasing tree species richness does not necessarily promote characteristics of natural enemy assemblages relevant for pest control in forests and thus not all functions that may be important in a multi-functional management context. Rather, tree species composition and identity will often be of crucial importance in determining forest ecosystem functions and services. The fact that the severe impact of Douglas fir persisted even in diversified tree species mixtures suggests that stand-level predator efficiency can be reduced for tree species growing adjacent to or in mixture with this species. This calls for a more thorough examination of the ecological consequences of the increasing use of this species in forestry across Europe, in particular considering that climate change may increase the potential of pest outbreaks and thus the need for adequate control in the next decades.},

The consequences of the resulting collapse of plant communities will depend partly on how quickly plant functional and phylogenetic diversity decline following pollinator extinctions. We investigated the functional and phylogenetic consequences of pollinator extinctions by simulating coextinctions in seven plant-pollinator networks coupled with independent data on plant phylogeny and functional traits. Declines in plant functional diversity were slower than expected under a scenario of random extinctions, while phylogenetic diversity often decreased faster than expected by chance. Our results show that plant functional diversity was relatively robust to plant-pollinator coextinctions, despite the underlying rapid loss of evolutionary history. Thus, our study suggests the possibility of uncoupled responses of functional and phylogenetic diversity to species coextinctions, highlighting the importance of considering both dimensions of biodiversity explicitly in ecological studies and when planning for the conservation of species and interactions.},

	abstract = {The pollination success of animal-pollinated plants depends on the temporal coupling between flowering schedules and pollinator availability. Within a population, individual plants exhibiting disparate flowering schedules will be exposed to different pollinators when the latter exhibit temporal turnover. The temporal overlap between individual plants and pollinators will result in a turnover of interactions, which can be analyzed through a network approach. We have explored the temporal dynamics of individual-based plant networks resulting from pairwise similarities in pollinator composition. During two flowering seasons, we surveyed the phenology and pollinator fauna of the individual plants from a population of Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). We analyzed the topology of these networks by means of their modularity, clustering, and core–periphery structure. These metrics are related to network functional properties such as cohesion, transitivity and centralization respectively. Afterwards, we analyzed the influence of each pollinator functional group on network topology. We found that network topology varied widely over time as a consequence of the differences in plant phenology and the idiosyncratic and contextual effect of pollinators. When integrating all temporary networks, the network became cohesive (non modular), transitive (locally clusterized), and centralized (core–periphery topology). These topologies could entail important consequences for plant reproduction. Our results highlight the importance of considering the entire flowering season and the necessity of making comprehensive temporal sampling when trying to build reliable interaction networks.},

	abstract = {Thelytoky, the asexual production of females, is rare in honey bees. However, it is ubiquitous in workers of the Cape honey bee Apis mellifera capensis. Thelytoky allows some workers to be reincarnated into the queen phenotype, and thereby selects for reproductive competition among workers. Thelytoky also acts as an exaptation for the emergence of reproductive parasites, the most extreme example of which is an entirely clonal ‘cancerous’ lineage of workers (the Clone) that lethally parasitises colonies of another subspecies Apis mellifera scutellata. The Clone is an enigma because thelytoky results in the accumulation of homozygosity at any loci that are free to recombine, yet the Clone retains considerable heterozygosity. The Clone pays a cost for its thelytoky: the selective removal of homozygous offspring at each generation. We propose that workers, queens and Clones have differing abilities to endure the costs and benefits of sex and asexuality, accounting for the heterogeneous distribution of reproductive strategies across the A. mellifera capensis population. We further suggest that multiple factors must fall into place for thelytoky to emerge as an effective reproductive strategy in a honey bee population, and that geographic isolation resulting in genetic drift and founder effects may have enabled thelytoky to emerge in A. mellifera capensis. Finally, we consider the honey bee in the broader context of haplodiploid Hymenoptera, and argue that constraints on the evolution of sex in non-haplodiploid taxa may make sexual reproduction an evolutionary ‘one-way street’.},

	abstract = {The diversity and abundance of wild insect pollinators have declined in many agricultural landscapes. Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14\% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.
Honeybees Can't Do It Alone
The majority of food crops require pollination to set fruit with the honeybee providing a pollination workhorse, with both feral and managed populations an integral component of crop management (see the Perspective by Tylianakis, published online 28 February). Garibaldi et al. (p. 1608, published online 28 February) now show that wild pollinators are also a vital part of our crop systems. In more than 40 important crops grown worldwide, wild pollinators improved pollination efficiency, increasing fruit set by twice that facilitated by honeybees. Burkle et al. (p. 1611, published online 28 February) took advantage of one of the most thorough and oldest data sets available on plant-pollinator interaction networks and recollected data on plant-pollinator interactions after more than 120 years of climate change and landscape alteration. The historical data set consists of observations collected by Charles Robertson near Carlinville, Illinois (USA), in the late 1800s on the phenology of plants and their pollinating insects, as well as information about which plants and pollinators interacted with one another. Many sites were revisited in the early 1970s and in 2009 and 2010 to collect similar plant-pollinator data. Pollinator function has declined through time, with bees showing lower visitation rates and lower fidelity to individual plant species.},

	abstract = {The pollination biology literature is dominated by examples of specialization between plants and their pollinators. However, a recent review shows that it is generalization that prevails in the field, with most plants having a number of pollinators and most pollinators visiting a number of plants. Consequently, the vast majority of plant–pollinator interactions are embedded in a complex web of plant–pollinator interactions. These plant-pollinator webs can be studied in the manner of conventional food webs and the aim of this paper is to illustrate how contemporary methods of web construction and analysis can be applied to plant-pollinator communities.},

Here, we use a novel phylogenetic approach to test whether biotic interactions constrain the transition to secondary sympatry following speciation. Applying this temporal framework to a diverse clade of passerine birds (Furnariidae), we reject models of geographic range overlap limited purely by dispersal or environmental constraints, and instead show that rates of secondary sympatry are positively associated with both the phylogenetic and morphological distance between species. Thus, transition rates to sympatry increase with time since divergence and accelerate as the ecological differences between species accumulate. Taken together, these results provide strong empirical evidence that biotic interactions – and primarily ecological competition – limit species distributions across large spatial and temporal scales. They also offer phylogenetic and trait-based metrics by which these interactions can be incorporated into ecological forecasting models.},

	abstract = {Semi-natural habitats such as heathland ecosystems are important for the conservation of biodiversity. Due to land use changes, these valuable ecosystems have become highly threatened. Nowadays, their management and restoration is of special relevance for nature conservation.

In this study, we used carabid beetles and spiders as bioindicators to evaluate the success of montane heathland restoration on former spruce forests. We compared three different treatments: (i) montane heathlands (MONHEATH), (ii) restoration (RESSITE) and (iii) control (CONTROL) sites.

Four to five years after conducting the restoration measures, all environmental variables, except soil moisture, significantly differed between MONHEATH on one hand and RESSITE and CONTROL on the other. MONHEATH was characterised by a high cover of dwarf shrubs; in contrast, RESSITE/CONTROL had a vegetation rich in herbs/grasses with some bare ground. Both carabid beetle and spider assemblage composition clearly reflected these differences in environmental conditions. Alpha-diversity (Simpson diversity, evenness) and niche positions were, however, only significantly different for spiders. Diversity as well as spider indicator values for shade and moisture were higher for MONHEATH.

Due to the cool and wet montane climate and the dense dwarf-shrub stands the carabid beetle and spider species characteristic of MONHEATH are typical woodland species. Four to five years after restoration, RESSITE and CONTROL still represent early successional stages with a low cover of the Ericaceae target dwarf shrubs (Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea), but are already home to some typical heathland carabid beetle and spider species that are missing in MONHEATH.},

	abstract = {Community ecology entered the 1970s with the belief that niche theory would supply a general theory of community structure. The lack of wide-spread empirical support for niche theory led to a focus on models specific to classes of communities such as lakes, intertidal communities, and forests. Today, the needs of conservation biology for metrics of “ecological health” that can be applied across types of communities prompts a renewed interest in the possibility of general theory for community ecology. Disputes about the existence of general patterns in community structure trace at least to the 1920s and continue today almost unchanged in concept, although now expressed through mathematical modeling. Yet, a new framework emerged in the 1980s from findings that community composition and structure depend as much on the processes that bring species to the boundaries of a community as by processes internal to a community, such as species interactions and co-evolution. This perspective, termed “supply-side ecology”, argued that community ecology was to be viewed as an “organic earth science” more than as a biological science. The absence of a general theory of the earth would then imply a corresponding absence of any general theory for the communities on the earth, and imply that the logical structure of theoretical community ecology would consist of an atlas of models special to place and geologic time. Nonetheless, a general theory of community ecology is possible similar in form to the general theory for evolution if the processes that bring species to the boundary of a community are analogized to mutation, and the processes that act on the species that arrive at a community are analogized to selection. All communities then share some version of this common narrative, permitting general theorems to be developed pertaining to all ecological communities. Still, the desirability of a general theory of community ecology is debatable because the existence of a general theory suppresses diversity of thought even as it allows generalizations to be derived. The pros and cons of a general theory need further discussion.},

Determining whether this result holds for real-world ecosystem services has remained elusive, however, largely due to the lack of analytical methods appropriate for large-scale, associational data. Here, we use a novel analytical approach, the Price equation, to partition the contribution to ecosystem services made by species richness, composition and abundance in four large-scale data sets on crop pollination by native bees. We found that abundance fluctuations of dominant species drove ecosystem service delivery, whereas richness changes were relatively unimportant because they primarily involved rare species that contributed little to function. Thus, the mechanism behind our results was the skewed species-abundance distribution. Our finding that a few common species, not species richness, drive ecosystem service delivery could have broad generality given the ubiquity of skewed species-abundance distributions in nature.},

	abstract = {1. Earlier studies used static models to evaluate the responses of mutualistic networks to external perturbations. Two classes of dynamics can be distinguished in ecological networks; population dynamics, represented mainly by changes in species abundances, and topological dynamics, represented by changes in the architecture of the web. 2. In this study, we model the temporal evolution of three empirical plant–pollination networks incorporating both population and topological dynamics. We test the hypothesis that topological plasticity, realized through the ability of animals to rewire their connections after depletion of host abundances, enhances tolerance of mutualistic networks to species loss. We also compared the performance of various rewiring rules in affecting robustness. 3. The results show that topological plasticity markedly increased the robustness of mutualistic networks. Our analyses also revealed that network robustness reached maximum levels when animals with less host plant availability were more likely to rewire. Also, preferential attachment to richer host plants, that is, to plants exhibiting higher abundance and few exploiters, enhances robustness more than other rewiring alternatives. 4. Our results highlight the potential role of topological plasticity in the robustness of mutualistic networks to species extinctions and suggest some plausible mechanisms by which the decisions of foragers may shape the collective dynamics of plant–pollinator systems.},

Yet, we have limited understanding of the consequences of evolutionary history on the structure of food webs and the services provided by biological communities. Drawing on 11 years of data from a long-term plant diversity experiment, we show that evolutionary history of plant communities – measured as phylogenetic diversity – strongly predicts diversity and abundance of herbivorous and predatory arthropods. Effects of plant species richness on arthropods become stronger when phylogenetic diversity is high. Plant phylogenetic diversity explains predator and parasitoid richness as strongly as it does herbivore richness. Our findings indicate that accounting for evolutionary relationships is critical to understanding the severity of species loss for food webs and ecosystems, and for developing conservation and restoration policies.},

We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60\% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.},

	abstract = {The leafhoppers, planthoppers and their allies (collectively known as the Auchenorrhyncha) are presented as a group of insects that are highly appropriate for studying grassland ecology and conservation, evaluating the conservation status of sites and monitoring environmental and habitat change. Semi-natural grasslands typically support dense populations and a wide range of species with diverse ecological strategies. Their numerical dominance in many grasslands means that they have considerable functional significance, both as herbivores and as prey for higher trophic levels. Population and assemblage studies are supported by good ecological knowledge about most species and modern identification keys. Hitherto, most studies have focused on the composition and structure of assemblages and how they are affected by conservation management. However, grasslands support many rare species with small and fragmented populations which deserve conservation attention in their own right, and recent work has started to reflect this. The effects of management on the composition and structure of grassland leafhopper populations and assemblages are described and an assessment is given of the main threats facing individual species and overall diversity. There is a need to synthesise the scattered literature on grassland leafhoppers, to provide a model for how the composition and structure of populations and assemblages respond to major environmental and anthropogenic gradients across large biogeographic areas. Such an analysis could help predict the impact of likely future changes in land use and climate.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the strengths of species interactions are distributed among species is critical for developing predictive models of natural food webs as well as for developing management and conservation strategies. Recently a number of ecologists have attempted to clarify the concepts of “strong-” and “weak-interactors” in a community, and to derive techniques for quantifying interaction strengths in the field, using metrics that are consistent, comparable, and of relevance to theoreticians. In this paper, we examine potential biases in different empirical approaches to quantifying variation in interaction strengths within and among natural communities. Using both simulated and published data, we explore the behavior of four commonly used or recently proposed empirical measures of the strength of consumer–prey interactions. The type of index used, the experimental protocol, and the underlying model of predator–prey interaction all strongly influence one’s perception of both (1) the distribution of interaction strengths among species (e.g., presence of “keystone” species), and (2) the specific identity of the interactions that appear to be most important. Raw treatment differences tend to emphasize effects on very abundant prey, while the three proportional indices tend to emphasize effects on extremely rare prey. Two of the proportional indices are inherently asymmetric about zero, and they inflate positive or negative effects, respectively. When predators exhibit a saturating functional response, the three proportional measures of per capita effect are biased toward a skewed distribution of interaction strengths dominated by effects on the rarest prey. Predator interference causes the per capita measures to emphasize the effects of rare predators. Estimates of per capita effects are also problematic when (1) the per capita effects are back-calculated from experiments designed to measure collective effects (e.g., predator exclusions), and (2) the collective effect of a predator is constant across a wide range of predator densities, as may be common for keystone predators. Finally, since all of the indices show time-dependent behavior, they are differentially suited for different experimental protocols (e.g., short-term vs. long-term results, or community initially near vs. far from equilibrium). All the indices explored here have the potential to provide useful, complementary information about ecological impacts of species in natural communities. In this analysis, we attempt to clarify what each index actually measures and the conditions under which each is most revealing.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted an increasing number of studies to reduce species diversity experimentally and examine how this alters the efficiency by which communities capture resources and convert those into biomass. So far, the generality of patterns and processes observed in individual studies have been the subjects of considerable debate. Here we present a formal meta-analysis of studies that have experimentally manipulated species diversity to examine how it affects the functioning of numerous trophic groups in multiple types of ecosystem. We show that the average effect of decreasing species richness is to decrease the abundance or biomass of the focal trophic group, leading to less complete depletion of resources used by that group. At the same time, analyses reveal that the standing stock of, and resource depletion by, the most species-rich polyculture tends to be no different from that of the single most productive species used in an experiment. Of the known mechanisms that might explain these trends, results are most consistent with what is called the {\textbar}[lsquo]{\textbar}sampling effect{\textbar}[rsquo]{\textbar}, which occurs when diverse communities are more likely to contain and become dominated by the most productive species. Whether this mechanism is widespread in natural communities is currently controversial. Patterns we report are remarkably consistent for four different trophic groups (producers, herbivores, detritivores and predators) and two major ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial). Collectively, our analyses suggest that the average species loss does indeed affect the functioning of a wide variety of organisms and ecosystems, but the magnitude of these effects is ultimately determined by the identity of species that are going extinct.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the relationship between species richness and productivity is crucial to understanding biodiversity in lakes. We investigated the relationship between the primary productivity of lake ecosystems and the number of species for lacustrine phytoplankton, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, macrophytes, and fish. Our study includes two parts: (1) a survey of 33 well-studied lakes for which data on six major taxonomic groups were available; and (2) a comparison of the effects of short- and long-term whole-lake nutrient addition on primary productivity and planktonic species richness. In the survey, species richness of all six taxa showed a significant quadratic response to increased annual primary productivity (14C estimate, g C·m−2·yr−1) when lake area is taken into account. However, the richness–productivity relationship for phytoplankton and fish was strongly dependent on lake area. The relationship for phytoplankton, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, and macrophytes was significantly unimodal. Species richness generally peaked at levels of primary productivity in the range of 30–300 g C·m−2·yr−1. For the average lake size, the highest biodiversity tended to occur in lakes with relatively low primary productivity, such as those found in the Northern Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the upper Midwest (United States) and in the Experimental Lakes Area of Ontario (Canada). Based on short-term (3 yr) and long-term (21–24 yr) experiments, we tested whether individual lakes respond to whole-lake enrichment experiments in the manner suggested by analyses of survey data. Experimental addition of nutrients produced varied and unpredictable responses in species richness, probably due to transient dynamics and time lags. Responses to nutrient addition were taxon and lake specific. Phytoplankton showed a variety of relationships between species richness and pelagic primary productivity (PPR), depending on the history of enrichment and recovery. No significant effect of primary productivity on rotifer richness occurred in any of the experimental lakes, whereas richness of crustacean zooplankton was negatively correlated with primary productivity in both the short- and long-term experiments.},

	abstract = {Cabin (2007) asks whether formal science is an effective framework and methodology for designing and implementing ecological restoration programs. He argues that beyond certain ancillary benefits, restoration science has little of practical value to offer the practice of restoration. He goes on to suggest that restoration science most often represents an impediment to restoration practice because an “ivory tower” mentality limits the utility of experiments and diverts research dollars away from answering practical questions. His conclusion is that a nonscientific gardening approach may be more effective at restoring degraded ecosystems. We disagree with this perspective because: (1) restoration science has moved beyond exclusively using “square grids” placed on small patches of land to examine treatment effects on species representation; (2) Cabin’s critique greatly undervalues the contribution of science to restoration practice even where the input of restoration scientists is not directly evident; and (3) the practice of restoration is unlikely to advance beyond small-scale and truly haphazard successes without well-designed studies that can provide peer-reviewed and widely accessible published information on the mechanisms underlying both successes and failures. We conclude that through integration with other disciplines, restoration science increasingly will provide novel approaches and tools needed to restore ecosystem composition, structure, and function at stand to landscape scales. As with the broader role of science in the human enterprise (Sagan 1996), the contribution of restoration science to restoration practice can only grow as the discipline matures.},

	abstract = {Grasslands restoration is a key management tool contributing to the long-term maintenance of insect populations, providing functional connectivity and mitigating against extinction debt across landscapes. As knowledge of grassland insect communities is limited, the lag between the initiation of restoration and the ability of these new habitats to contribute to such processes is unclear. Using ten data sets, ranging from 3 to 14 years, we investigate the lag between restoration and the establishment of phytophagous beetle assemblages typical of species rich grasslands. We used traits and ecological characteristics to determine factors limiting beetle colonisation, and also considered how food-web structure changed during restoration. For sites where seed addition of host-plants occurred the success in replicating beetle assemblages increased over time following a negative exponential function. Extrapolation beyond the existing data set tentatively suggested that success would plateau after 20 years, representing a c. 60\% increase in assemblage similarity to target grasslands. In the absence of seed addition, similarity to the target grasslands showed no increase over time. Where seed addition was used the connectance of plant–herbivore food webs decreased over time, approaching values typical of species rich grasslands after c. 7 years. This trend was, however, dependent on the inclusion of a single site containing data in excess of 6 years of restoration management. Beetles not capable of flight, those showing high degrees of host-plant specialisation and species feeding on nationally rare host plants take between 1 and 3 years longer to colonise. Successful grassland restoration is underpinned by the establishment of host-plants, although individual species traits compound the effects of poor host-plant establishment to slow colonisation. The use of pro-active grassland restoration to mitigate against future environmental change should account for lag periods in excess of 10 years if the value of these habitats is to be fully realised.},

Studies at community scale highlight variations in conservatism strength depending on the characteristics of the ecological interaction studied. However, the heterogeneity of datasets and methods used prevent to compare results between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Here we perform such a comparison by taking plant–insect communities as a study case, with data on plant–herbivore and plant–pollinator networks. Our analysis reveals that plants acting as resources for herbivores exhibit the strongest conservatism in species interaction among the four interacting groups. Conservatism levels are similar for insect pollinators, insect herbivores and plants as interacting partners of pollinators, although insect pollinators tend to have a slightly higher conservatism than the two others. Our results thus clearly support the current view that within antagonistic networks, conservatism is stronger for species as resources than for species as consumer. Although the pattern tends to be opposite for plant–pollinator networks, our results suggest that asymmetry in conservatism is much less pronounced between the pollinators and the plant they interact with. We discuss these differences in conservatism strength in relation with the processes structuring plant–insect communities.},

	abstract = {The Africanized honeybee Apis mellifera (AHB) is an invasive species spread over all Brazilian biomes, which has negative impacts on native bee populations, but whose impacts on native plants are still controversial. In order to understand how its impacts extend to the pollination service at the community level, we studied the AHB and its interactions in a multi-species context using network theory. We analyzed six pollination networks from the Brazilian Caatinga, a xeric biome where beekeeping is increasing very quickly. The AHB occupied a central position in all networks, as it was responsible for a large share of the interactions observed (14 ± 7 \%) and bound together different modules. By simulating the removal of the AHB from each network, we observed no effects on connectance, but a strong decrease in nestedness (−23 ± 19 \%) and an increase in modularity (8 ± 5 \%). The robustness of networks to cumulative random extinctions was on average not affected. In summary, our evidence points out that the AHB induces significant changes in the structure of native pollination networks, mainly by making them more cohesive and monopolizing many interactions. Although the AHB did not affect network robustness, its net impact on the pollination service may be negative, because this invasive species is very generalistic and may not be an efficient pollinator for some native plants.},

The effects spread through the community by direct and indirect interactions. The network perspective on ecology can help map the pathways of these effects, for food webs, the pathways of indirect trophic interactions. Indirect interactions typically decay in intensity as they spread. Therefore, there is a conceptual maximum range in topological space beyond which interactions have no effects, even though all species remain connected. Neither the local characteristics of species, nor the global characteristics of entire webs, suitably quantify this range. We therefore apply intermediate scale indices that reflect the limitations imposed by effect damping in networks. We present a complex analysis of the topological positional importance of species in the Chesapeake Bay web. This web is a carbon-flow network that represents trophic interactions. We present several different indices reflecting different properties and discuss which questions the different indices best answer. We look for the best indices for identifying the key players in ecosystem functioning. Our study contributes to the quantification of relative species importance and provides an exact and a priori determination of a class of candidate keystone species that can inform applied and conservation ecology as well as theoretical concerns.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The replacement of native plants by alien species is likely to affect other trophic levels, particularly phytophagous insects. Nevertheless, the effect of alien plants on insect biomass has not yet been quantified. Given their critical role in transferring energy from plants to higher trophic levels, if alien plants do affect insect biomass, this could have far-reaching consequences for community structure. We used 35 food webs to evaluate the impacts of alien plants on insect productivity in a native forest in the Azores. Our food webs quantified plants, insect herbivores, and their parasitoids, which allowed us to test the effects of alien plants on species richness and evenness, insect abundance, insect biomass, and food-web structure. Species richness of plants and insects, along with plant species evenness, declined as the level of plant invasion increased. Nevertheless, none of the 4 quantitative food-web descriptors (number of links, link density, connectance, and interaction evenness) varied significantly with plant invasion independent of the size of the food web. Overall, insect abundance was not significantly affected by alien plants, but insect biomass was significantly reduced. This effect was due to the replacement of large insects on native plants with small insects on alien plants. Furthermore, the impact of alien plants was sufficiently severe to invert the otherwise expected pattern of species-richness decline with increased elevation. We predict a decrease in insect productivity by over 67\% if conservation efforts fail to halt the invasion of alien plants in the Azores.},

Abstract
Theory developed from studying changes in the structure and function of communities during natural or managed succession can guide the restoration of particular communities. We constructed 30 quantitative plant–flower visitor networks along a managed successional gradient to identify the main drivers of change in network structure. We then applied two alternative restoration strategies in silico (restoring for functional complementarity or redundancy) to data from our early successional plots to examine whether different strategies affected the restoration trajectories. Changes in network structure were explained by a combination of age, tree density and variation in tree diameter, even when variance explained by undergrowth structure was accounted for first. A combination of field data, a network approach and numerical simulations helped to identify which species should be given restoration priority in the context of different restoration targets. This combined approach provides a powerful tool for directing management decisions, particularly when management seeks to restore or conserve ecosystem function.},

In order to return the fire disturbance dynamics and to increase the amount of dead wood, restoration actions are urgently needed. We studied the effects of restoring young (under 30 years old) pine-dominated (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest stands on saproxylic beetle assemblages in eastern Finland, focusing especially on rare, red-listed, and pyrophilous (RRLP) species. Our experiment included a restoration treatment including two tree felling levels for fuel load (10 or 20 m3/ha) followed by burning, and an untreated control. We sampled beetles before restoration in 2005, during the year of restoration in 2006, and in two post-treatment years in 2007 and 2011. Both restoration treatments increased the number of saproxylic and RRLP species. The species richness increased most in the year of restoration in 2006 and this trend continued in the following year 2007, but no differences in species assemblages were detected between the two fuel load levels. By 2011, however, the species richness and abundance had declined back to the pre-treatment level. We suggest that restoration burning can also be directed to young forests where biodiversity values are initially low. On the basis of the observed decline in the species richness, we suggest that fire could be introduced in neighboring areas in approximately 5-year intervals to maintain populations of the most demanding pyrophilous species.},

	abstract = {Most species disappear by the processes of background extinction, yet those processes are poorly understood. We analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of 19 Cenozoic terrestrial mammalian clades with rich fossil records that are now fully extinct or in diversity decline. We find their diversity loss was not just a consequence of “gamblers ruin” but resulted from the evolutionary loss to the Red Queen, a failure to keep pace with a deteriorating environment. Diversity loss is driven equally by both depressed origination rates and elevated extinction rates. Although we find diversity-dependent origination and extinction rates, the diversity of each clade only transiently equaled the implied equilibrium diversity. Thus, the processes that drove diversity loss in terrestrial mammal clades were fundamentally nonequilibrial and overwhelmed diversity-dependent processes.
Background Extinction
Diversity results through both the processes of species origination and extinction. However, studies of extinction have tended to focus on mass extinctions, despite the fact that the background extinction represents a greater loss in terms of the absolute number of extinct taxa. In order to identify what factors affect this rate of background extinction, Quental and Marshall (p. 290, published online 20 June) explored the dynamics of 19 mammalian clades and compared the rates of expansions and declines among taxa to expected models assuming random processes. Most clades decline to extinction in a “driven” manner—that is, faster than expected by chance alone.},

	abstract = {Trait-based community assembly theory suggests that trait variation among co-occurring species is shaped by two main processes: abiotic filtering, important in stressful environments and promoting similarity, and competition, more important in productive environments and promoting dissimilarity. Previous studies have indeed found trait similarity to decline along productivity gradients. However, these studies have always been done on single trophic levels. Here, we investigated how interactions between trophic levels affect trait similarity patterns along environmental gradients. We propose three hypotheses for the main drivers of trait similarity patterns of plants and herbivores along environmental gradients: (1) environmental control of both, (2) bottom-up control of herbivore trait variation, and (3) top-down control of grass trait variation. To test this, we collected data on the community composition and trait variation of grasses (41 species) and grasshoppers (53 species) in 50 plots in a South African savanna. Structural equation models were used to investigate how the range and spacing of within-community functional trait values of both grasses and their insect herbivores (grasshoppers; Acrididae) respond to (1) rainfall and fire frequency gradients and (2) the trait similarity patterns of the other trophic level. The analyses revealed that traits of co-occurring grasses became more similar toward lower rainfall and higher fire frequency (environmental control), while showing little evidence for top-down control. Grasshopper trait range patterns, on the other hand, were mostly directly driven by vegetation structure and grass trait range patterns (bottom-up control), while environmental factors had mostly indirect effects via plant traits. Our study shows the potential to expand trait-based community assembly theory to include trophic interactions.},

	abstract = {The biology of honey bees involves a host of developmental, behavioral, and physiological components that allow thousands of individual bees to form complex social units. Fueled by a wealth of information from new genomic technologies, a new approach, sociogenomics, uses a focus on the genome to integrate the molecular underpinnings and ultimate explanations of social life. This approach has resulted in a massive influx of data from the honey bee genome and transcriptome, a flurry of research activity, and new insights into honey bee biology. Here, we provide an up-to-date review describing how the honey bee has been successfully studied using this approach, highlighting how the integration of genomic information into honey bee research has provided insights into worker division of labor, communication, caste differences and development, evolution, and honey bee health. We also highlight how genomic studies in other eusocial insect species have provided insights into social evolution via comparative analyses. These data have led to several important new insights about how social behavior is organized on a genomic level, including (1) the fact that gene expression is highly dynamic and responsive to the social environment, (2) that large-scale changes in gene expression can contribute to caste and behavioral differences, (3) that transcriptional networks regulating these behaviors can be related to previously established hormonal mechanisms, and (4) that some genes and pathways retain conserved roles in behavior across contexts and social insect taxa.},

While it is well known how they affect the feeding preferences of aboveground herbivores, this information is lacking for soil ecosystems, where examining plant–herbivore trophic interactions is difficult. We performed a mesocosm experiment assessing how plant identity and diversity affect the food choice of Agriotes larvae, which are soil-living generalist herbivores. We offered four plant species, (maize, a grass, a legume, and a forb) at varying combinations and diversity levels to these larvae, and analyzed their feeding behavior using stable isotopes. We hypothesized that (1) their food choice is driven by preference for certain plant species rather than by root abundance and that (2) the preference for specific plants changes with increasing plant diversity. We found that larvae preferred the grass and legume but avoided maize and the forb. Whether a plant was preferred or avoided was independent of diversity, but the extent of avoidance or preference changed with increasing plant diversity. Our findings reveal that the dietary choice of soil-living generalist herbivores is determined by plant-specific traits rather than root abundance. Our data also suggest that soil herbivore feeding preferences are modulated by plant diversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  Variation in structural and compositional attributes of tropical savannas are described in relation to variation in annual rainfall and soil texture along a subcontinental-scale gradient of rainfall in the wet-dry tropics of the Northern Territory, Australia. Rainfall varies along the gradient from over 1500 mm p.a. in the Darwin region (c. 12° S) to less than 500 mm in the Tennant Creek region (c. 18° S). Soils are patchy, and sands, loams and clays may occur in all major districts within the region. We utilized a large data set (1657 quadrats ° 291 woody species; with numerous measured and derived sample variables) covering an area of 0.5 million km2. Correlations between floristic composition of woody species and environmental variables were assessed using DCA ordination and vector fitting of environmental variables. Vectors of annual rainfall and soil texture were highly correlated with variation in species composition. Multiple regression analyses incorporating linear and quadratic components of mean annual rainfall and topsoil clay content were performed on three structural attributes (tree height, tree cover, tree basal area) and two compositional attributes (woody species richness, deciduous tree species richness). Tree height declined with decreasing rainfall; cover, basal area, woody species richness and deciduous species richness all declined with decreasing rainfall and increasing soil clay content. Regression models accounted for between 17\% and 45\% of the variation in the data sets. Variation in other factors such as soil depth, landscape position and recent land-use practices (for which there were no data on an individual quadrat basis) are likely to have contributed to the large residual variation in the data set.},

The arthropods associated with these plants were sampled on 20 dates over a 3-year period. The status of the herbivore species was measured by their rank in biomass in each sample. The two most prominent species, Phyllotreta cruciferae and Pieris rapae, maintained high status throughout the investigation, but another important species, Brevicoryne brassicae, was absent for an entire season. Pit feeders usually formed the most important herbivore guild. Nevertheless, the guild spectrum, which describes the functional structure of the fauna, varied widely in time and space. The size distributions of species and of individuals were both highly skewed toward the smaller sizes. Herbivore loads, the mean biomass of herbivores per 100 g of consumable foliage, were consistently higher in the pure stands. Moreover, herbivore loads varied significantly with season in each experimental habitat. Both the number of herbivore species and the diversity of the herbivore load were greater in the diverse habitat. Biomass was more heavily concentrated among the prominent herbivores in the pure stands; increased dominance, rather than differences in species richness, appeared to be the major cause for the lower herbivore diversity in this habitat. The diversity of predators and parasitoids was higher in the pure stands. Most of the abundant species found on collards shared a similar narrow range of hosts. As a result the species in this core group of herbivores and parasitoids were regularly associated with each other. Predators and the less abundant herbivores tended to be less specialized and served to link the collard association with the surrounding community. Plant-arthropod associations are representative of component communities, well-integrated systems that form portions of larger compound communities. This distinction facilitates the analysis of community structure. Microclimates and the effectiveness of @'enemies@' did not appear to differ sufficiently in the two experimental habitats to account for the observed differences in the herbivore load. The results suggest a new proposition, the resource concentration hypothesis, which states that herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands; that the most specialized species frequently attain higher relative densities in simple environments; and that, as a result, biomass tends to become concentrated in a few species, causing a decrease in the diversity of herbivores in pure stands.},

	abstract = {Over the last 60 years changes to the management of species-rich mesotrophic grasslands have resulted in the large-scale loss and degradation of this habitat across Europe. Restoration of such grasslands on agriculturally improved pastures provides a potentially valuable approach to the conservation of these threatened areas. Over a four-year period a replicated block design was used to test the effects of seed addition (green hay spreading and brush harvest collection) and soil disturbance on the restoration of phytophagous beetle and plant communities. Patterns of increasing restoration success, particularly where hay spreading and soil disturbance were used in combination, were identified for the phytophagous beetles. In the case of the plants, however, initial differences in restoration success in response to these same treatments were not followed by subsequent temporal changes in plant community similarity to target mesotrophic grassland. It is possible that the long-term consequences of the management treatments would not be the establishment of beetle and plant communities characteristic of the targets for restoration. Restoration management to enhance plant establishment using hay spreading and soil disturbance techniques would, however, still increase community similarity in both taxa to that of species-rich mesotrophic grasslands, and so raise their conservation value.},

	abstract = {Although grasslands are crucial habitats for European butterflies, large-scale declines in quality and area have devastated many species. Grassland restoration can contribute to the recovery of butterfly populations, although there is a paucity of information on the long-term effects of management. Using eight UK data sets (9–21 years), we investigate changes in restoration success for (1) arable reversion sites, were grassland was established on bare ground using seed mixtures, and (2) grassland enhancement sites, where degraded grasslands are restored by scrub removal followed by the re-instigation of cutting/grazing. We also assessed the importance of individual butterfly traits and ecological characteristics in determining colonisation times. Consistent increases in restoration success over time were seen for arable reversion sites, with the most rapid rates of increase in restoration success seen over the first 10 years. For grasslands enhancement there were no consistent increases in restoration success over time. Butterfly colonisation times were fastest for species with widespread host plants or where host plants established well during restoration. Low mobility butterfly species took longer to colonise. We show that arable reversion is an effective tool for the management of butterfly communities. We suggest that as restoration takes time to achieve, its use as a mitigation tool against future environmental change (i.e. by decreasing isolation in fragmented landscapes) needs to take into account such time lags.},

	abstract = {Interactions between oil-collecting bees and oil-producing flowers are a very specialized mutualism, whose natural history is well known at the organism and population levels. In this study, we assessed these interactions at the biome level with a network approach, and hypothesized that widespread bee and plant species would occupy different ecological functional roles (Eltonian niches) in different biomes. Furthermore, we expected the most important functional roles in each network to be occupied more frequently by 
Byrsonima oil flowers and Centris oil bees, which share the longest coevolutionary history in the Neotropics. By compiling data from 40 articles on oil flower interactions within the Malpighiaceae family, we built six networks for different Brazilian biomes. We assessed the ecological functional role of each species in pollination networks of oil flowers through the metric known as ‘network functional role’. Although 90 percent of the species occupied peripheral roles in each network, some were found to occupy highly central roles. Oil flowers of the genera
Byrsonima and
Banisteriopsis and oil bees of the genera
Centris and
Epicharis were the most important species in all networks, as they made a disproportionally high number of interactions (hubs), or helped bind together different modules (connectors). Our findings suggest that functional roles vary geographically and seem to be affected by local conditions in different biomes. Furthermore, coevolutionary history seems to play an important role in determining functional roles in oil flower networks, although other factors are probably also important, especially the degree of specialization in this kind of interaction.},

The six-step process presented here enabled us to identify metrics associated with streams that can be used in the analysis of human well-being; we illustrate these steps with data from a regional stream survey. Continued refinement and application of this framework will require ongoing collaboration between natural and social scientists. Framework application could result in more useful and relevant data, leading to more informed decisions in the management of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Invasive plants are considered a major cause of ecosystem degradation worldwide. While their impacts on native plants have been widely reported, there is little information on how these impacts propagate through food webs and affect species at higher trophic levels. Using a quantitative food web approach we evaluated the impacts of an invasive plant on plant–herbivore–parasitoid communities, asking specifically how diet breadth influences the propagation of such impacts. Measuring the impact of the alien plant at the plant level seriously underestimated the community-level effect of this weed as it also caused changes in the abundance of native herbivores and parasitoids, along with a decrease in parasitoid species richness. The invading plant affected specialist and generalist subsets of communities differently, having significant and strong negative impacts on the abundance of all specialists with no negative effect on generalist consumers. Specialist consumer decline led to further disruptions of top-down regulatory mechanisms, releasing generalist species from competition via shared natural enemies. Plant invasion also significantly increased the evenness of species abundance of all trophic levels in the food webs, as well as the evenness of species interaction frequency. Extending impact evaluation to higher trophic levels and considering changes in trophic diversity within levels is hence essential for a full evaluation of the consequences of invasion by alien plants. Moreover, information on diet breadth of species in the invaded community should be taken into account when evaluating/predicting the impacts on any introduced species.},

	abstract = {Intensive agriculture has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and the specialist flora and fauna associated with the semi-natural grasslands of low-intensity pastoral systems throughout northwest Europe. Techniques employed to restore and re-create these grasslands on agricultural land in the UK are reviewed. Extensive cutting and grazing management have been shown to diversify improved swards and facilitate re-colonisation on ex-arable soils, although rates of re-assembly of plant communities with affinity to existing semi-natural grasslands have generally been slow. On former agriculturally improved swards, nutrient depletion has accelerated this process, especially where “gaps” for establishment have been created. Similarly, on ex-arable soils “nutrient stripping” and sowing with diverse seed mixtures has led to the rapid development of species-rich swards. On free draining brown earths such an approach may be required to restore grassland communities where soil phosphorous concentrations exceed semi-natural levels by more than 10 mg/l (using Olsen's bicarbonate extractant). However, the appropriateness of this threshold for other soil types requires further sampling. Although restored grasslands are likely to contribute to national biodiversity targets success will ultimately depend on the reinstatement of the communities and ecological functions of semi-natural references. Although this is technically feasible for a few plant assemblages, less is known about the re-assembly of microbial and faunal communities, or the importance of trophic interactions during grassland succession. As a consequence, more research is required on the functional attributes of semi-natural grasslands, as well as the methods required to restore localised types, novel nutrient depletion techniques, the “phased” introduction of desirable but poor-performing species and the performance of different genotypes during grassland restoration.},

	abstract = {1. Both top-down and bottom-up influences, such as grazing herbivores and edaphic factors, may maintain species-rich vegetation by preventing dominant plants from reducing diversity. However, the interaction between grazing and other processes maintaining diversity, particularly in ecosystems with multiple herbivores, is poorly understood. We manipulated access by small and large vertebrate herbivores on an edaphically heterogeneous site. We investigated whether: (i) grazing and soil properties interacted in their impact on vegetation, (ii) the effects of herbivores on different plant functional groups depended on soil properties, and (iii) small and large herbivores were functionally equivalent. 2. Treatments allowed mixed rabbit and livestock grazing, rabbit grazing only or no grazing and were replicated within three areas differing in vegetation, soil nutrient availability and pH. Soil properties, plant species composition, vegetation height and above- and below-ground biomass were measured after 6 years. 3. Bottom-up and top-down impacts were both important, with soil properties and grazing explaining 42.1\% and 9.2\% of the variability in species composition between plots, respectively. Grazing enhanced the impact of soil properties on the plant community by preventing dominance by Ulex europaeus and maintaining differences in species composition between the areas. 4. Grazing consistently increased species richness across vegetation types, but the responses of different plant functional groups depended on area. For instance, grazing removal caused graminoid abundance to increase in the area where grasses were the dominant functional group, but to decrease in other areas. 5. Small herbivores (rabbits) were only partially functionally equivalent to larger grazing herbivores (livestock), as rabbit grazing pressure did not increase in plots ungrazed by large herbivores. The results suggested a facilitative relationship between large and small herbivores, with large herbivores improving forage quality and increasing access to plots by rabbits. 6. Synthesis. (i) Grazing and soil properties interacted in their impact on the composition and diversity of vegetation, (ii) the effects of herbivores on particular plant functional groups depended on the characteristics of the area, and (iii) small and large herbivores were not functionally equivalent, with small vertebrate herbivores unable to replace the impact of larger herbivores when these were removed.},

It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.},

We conducted an experiment to examine how arthropod community structure on a foundation riparian tree mediates the ability of insectivorous birds to influence tree growth. We built whole-tree bird exclosures around 35 mature cottonwood (Populus spp.) trees at two sites in northern Utah, USA, to measure the effect of bird predation on arthropod herbivore and predator species richness, abundance, and biomass, and on tree performance. We maintained bird exclosures over two growing seasons and conducted nondestructive arthropod surveys that recorded 63 652 arthropods of 689 morphospecies representing 19 orders. Five major patterns emerged: (1) We found a significant trophic cascade (18\% reduction in trunk growth when birds were excluded) only at one site in one year. (2) The significant trophic cascade was associated with higher precipitation, tree growth, and arthropod abundance, richness, and biomass than other site–year combinations. (3) The trophic cascade was weak or not evident when tree growth and insect populations were low apparently due to drought. (4) Concurrent with the stronger trophic cascade, bird predation significantly reduced total arthropod abundance, richness, and biomass. Arthropod biomass was 67\% greater on trees without bird predation. This pattern was driven largely by two herbivore groups (folivores and non-aphid sap-feeders) suggesting that birds targeted these groups. (5) Three species of folivores (Orthoptera: Melanoplus spp.) were strong links between birds and trees and were only present in the site and the year in which the stronger trophic cascade occurred. Our results suggest that this trophic system is predominately bottom-up driven, but under certain conditions the influence of top predators can stimulate whole tree growth. When the most limiting factor for tree growth switched from water availability to herbivory, the avian predators gained the potential to reduce herbivory. This potential could be realized when strong links between the birds and plant, i.e., species that were both abundant herbivores and preferred prey, were present.},

Abstract
Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

	abstract = {Aim  To determine the relationship between the species richness of woody plants and that of mammals after accounting for the effect of environmental variables. Location  Southern Africa, including Namibia, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and part of Mozambique. Methods  We used a comprehensive dataset including the species richness of mammals and of woody plants and environmental variables for 118 quadrats (each of 25,000 km2) across southern Africa, and used structural equation models (SEMs) and spatial regressions to examine the relationship between the species richness of woody plants and of mammal trophic guilds (herbivores, insectivores, carni/omnivores) and habitat guilds (aquatic/fossorial, ground-living, climbers, aerial), after controlling for environment. We compared the results of SEMs with those of single-predictor regressions (without controlling for environment) and of spatial regressions (controlling for both environment and residual spatial autocorrelation). Results  The geographical variation of mammal species richness in southern Africa was strongly and positively related to that of woody plant species richness, and this relationship held for most mammal guilds even when the influence of environment and spatial autocorrelation had been accounted for. However, the effect of woody plant species richness on the richness of aquatic/fossorial species almost disappeared after controlling for environment, suggesting that the congruence in species richness patterns between these two groups results from similar responses to the same environmental variables. For many mammal guilds, the relative role of environmental predictors as measured by standardized partial regression coefficients changed depending on whether non-spatial single-predictor regressions, non-spatial SEMs, or spatial regressions were used. Main conclusions  Woody plants are important determinants of the species richness of most mammal guilds in southern Africa, even when controlling for environment and residual spatial autocorrelation. Environmental correlates with animal species richness as measured by simple correlations or single-predictor regressions might not always reflect direct effects; they might, at least to some degree, result from indirect effects via woody plants. Interpretations of the strength of the effect of environmental variables on mammal species richness in southern Africa depend largely on whether spatial or non-spatial models are used. We therefore stress the need for caution when interpreting environmental ‘effects’ on broad-scale patterns of species richness if spatial and non-spatial methods yield contrasting results.},

	abstract = {Plant resources, predators, and abiotic conditions represent three major factors that potentially influence insect herbivore abundance in terrestrial ecosystems. In nitrogen (N)-limited environments the potential for bottom-up (plant resource) control is strong because plant quality may limit herbivore abundance. However, extremes in abiotic conditions, such as temperature and moisture, can mask such effects. I tested these hypotheses in an 8-yr field experiment that measured responses of plants and grasshoppers (Orthoptera) to N addition and exclusion of bird predators in an N-limited old-field prairie in east-central Minnesota. Plant biomass increased by 150-400\%, and plant tissue N increased by 78\% in response to N addition of 17 g· m-2· yr-1. Total grasshopper density responded positively to N addition following warm years. However, multiple regressions suggested that grasshopper densities were related much more strongly to thermal conditions than to soil N. Bird exclusion yielded weak effects that varied over time and may have been influenced by compensatory responses of other grasshopper predators to bird exclosures. Grasshopper feeding guilds differed in the relationship between their in vivo dry-matter digestibility (DMD) and plant tissue N, and this physiological differnce explained their drastically different responses to N addition. Plant quality (in vivo DMD) increased with plant tissue N for mixed-feeding grasshoppers, and accordingly, their density was positively correlated with soil N. Plant quality did not change with plant tissue N for grass feeders, and their densities were negatively correlated with soil N. Both guilds responded positively to warmer thermal conditions, but mixed-feeder densities were negatively related to previous year's precipitation, and grass-feeder densities were not effected by precipitation. These results support the hypothesis that bottom-up influences of insect herbivores can be important in N-limited systems but do not support the hypothesis that more productive environments necessarily support greater top-down influences. Thermal conditions may interact with or eliminate bottom-up effects. Furthermore, different guilds within the herbivore trophic level may be influenced differently by N addition, predators, and abiotic conditions. These results suggest that exploring the mechanisms of interaction between abiotic and trophic influences within components of food webs is likely to yield many new insights into the regulation of herbivore communities.},

	abstract = {Pollinator constancy and pollen carryover are both thought to mitigate competitive effects that result when shared pollinators cause loss of pollen to heterospecific flowers. I present analytical and simulation models to investigate how pollinator constancy and pollen carryover interact with each other and with the relationship between pollen receipt and seed set to determine pollination success in competitive environments. With inconstant pollinators, increased pollen carryover reduces variance in pollen receipt without affecting average pollen receipt. Consequently, for flowers requiring at least a threshold quantity of pollen for success, rare flowers with inconstant pollinators benefit from reduced carryover, especially for high pollen receipt thresholds, whereas common flowers benefit from increased carryover, especially for low receipt thresholds. Pollinator constancy is predicted to increase pollen receipt, especially if pollen carryover rates are low. As a result, increased pollinator constancy reduces the range of pollen receipt thresholds for which carryover is beneficial. Similarly, for flowers whose pollination success is a convex function of pollen receipt, carryover is expected to increase fecundity if pollinators are inconstant, but with even a low degree of pollinator constancy, carryover reduces fecundity. These results predict that rare plants with many ovules per flower benefit from dispersing aggregations of pollen, especially if their pollinators exhibit constancy, whereas plants with inconstant pollinators and low thresholds of pollen receipt benefit from pollen grains dispersing individually to increase the number of flowers reached by the pollen.},

Our network is constructed from empirical observations of 11 animal groups in 12 habitats on farmland. We simulated sequential habitat removal scenarios: randomly; according to prior information; and with a genetic algorithm to identify best- and worst-case permutations of habitat loss. We identified two semi-natural habitats (waste ground and hedgerows together comprising {\textless} 5\% of the total area of the farm) as disproportionately important to the integrity of the overall network.

We offer an explanation based on the stability of food chains that have been shifted away from linearity to be more web-like. We start with a simple example of food webs of two to six species arranged so that species consume all those with a trophic level less than their own. The probability of stability, for such “universal omnivory” chains declined strongly with chain length, and was as low as 1\% with six level chains but highest for two and three level chains. We further explored the influence of chain length on food web stability by testing food webs with varying levels of connectance that were constructed either randomly or with the niche model. By additionally altering the relative impacts of predators on prey, and vice-versa, we test the role of our assumptions on the relationship between chain length and stability. Food webs characterized by low to moderate degrees of connectance, asymmetrical interactions, and relatively weak density dependence showed a pattern of reduced stability with longer trophic chains. The simple view that food webs characterized by long trophic chains are less stable seems to resolve the long-standing question of why there are so few trophic levels in nature.},

There is increasing evidence that restoration ecologists should be most concerned with restoring species interactions rather than species diversity per se [1]. Rewilding with taxon substitutes, the intentional introduction of exotic species to replace the ecosystem functions of recently extinct species, is one way to reverse ecosystem dysfunction following the loss of species interactions [2]. This is highly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorous scientific studies [4]. Here we present the first empirical evidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken as a hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option. On Ile aux Aigrettes, a 25-hectare island off Mauritius, the critically endangered large-fruited endemic ebony, Diospyros egrettarum (Ebenaceae), was seed-dispersal limited after the extinction of all native large-bodied frugivores, including giant tortoises. We introduced exotic Aldabra giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebony seeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits and disperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoise gut passage also improved seed germination, leading to the widespread, successful establishment of new ebony seedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of these exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies. We argue for more reversible rewilding experiments to investigate whether extinct species interactions can be restored.},

Abstract
A major current challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand how networks of interacting species shape the coevolutionary process. We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {* A major question in ecology is to know how ecosystem function is affected by the number of species. After two decades of research, the nature, shape, and causes of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning remain unresolved. Huston () suggested that a statistical ‘sampling effect’ for a few dominant species produced the patterns observed in experiments, while Tilman et al. () argued that the observed responses were due to the number of species rather than the properties of a few.


* Here, we present a general, theoretical and parsimonious model using combinatorial probabilities to describe the assembly effect as a probabilistic process. Our basic assumption is that community function is determined by random drawing from a fixed species pool composed of three classes of species. The species classes differ in their effect on community function and are ordered in a simple dominance hierarchy (subordinate, dominant and super-dominant species). Community function is determined by prevalent dominance rules: the dominance by the majority of species mimics the effect of dominant species, i.e. the function is determined by the dominant or super-dominant species class the most numerous within the community; the dominance by the presence of species mimics the effect of keystone species, i.e. the function is determined by the species that is ranked highest in the dominance hierarchy.


* The model produces significant fits to four experimental data sets obtained for plant and microbial communities, including monotonic and hump-shaped curves. The results indicate that the model gave good fits under both the dominance rules in any data set, suggesting that the random sampling effect provides a parsimonious explanation for the various relationships observed in diversity-ecosystem functioning experiments.


* The model describes a random assembly process that produces variation in ecosystem functioning in response to number of species selected from a regional species pool composed of several classes of species differing in their ecosystem effects and relative dominance. This simple model reproduces all shapes of diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships reported in the experimental literature. The results suggest that the multi-faceted response of ecosystems to biodiversity may be nothing more than manifestations of random assembly effects and variation in species properties.},

However, the connectivity distribution does not uncover all the complexity of their topology. Here, we analyse the relation between the connectivity of a species and the average connectivity of its nearest neighbours in three of the most resolved community food webs. We compare the pattern arising with the one recently reported for protein networks and for a simple null model of a random network. Whereas two highly connected nodes are unlikely to be connected between each other in protein networks, the reverse happens in food webs. We discuss this difference in organization in relation to the robustness of biological networks to different types of perturbation.},

	abstract = {Human activity can degrade ecosystem function by reducing species number (richness) and by skewing the relative abundance of species (evenness). Conservation efforts often focus on restoring or maintaining species number, reflecting the well-known impacts of richness on many ecological processes. In contrast, the ecological effects of disrupted evenness have received far less attention, and developing strategies for restoring evenness remains a conceptual challenge. In farmlands, agricultural pest-management practices often lead to altered food web structure and communities dominated by a few common species, which together contribute to pest outbreaks. Here we show that organic farming methods mitigate this ecological damage by promoting evenness among natural enemies. In field enclosures, very even communities of predator and pathogen biological control agents, typical of organic farms, exerted the strongest pest control and yielded the largest plants. In contrast, pest densities were high and plant biomass was low when enemy evenness was disrupted, as is typical under conventional management. Our results were independent of the numerically dominant predator or pathogen species, and so resulted from evenness itself. Moreover, evenness effects among natural enemy groups were independent and complementary. Our results strengthen the argument that rejuvenation of ecosystem function requires restoration of species evenness, rather than just richness. Organic farming potentially offers a means of returning functional evenness to ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Antipredator strategies employed by prey may be specific (effective against only one type of predator) or non-specific (effective against all predators). To examine the effects of the specificity of antipredator behaviour on biodiversity and community complexity, we analyse mathematical models including both evolutionary and population dynamics of a system including multiple prey species and multiple predator species. The models assume that all predator species change in their prey choice and all prey species have evolutionary change in their antipredator effort in evolution. The traits of each species change in an adaptive manner, whose rate is proportional to the slope of their fitness function. We calculate community complexity, resource-overlap between predators, an index of biodiversity and other properties of the coevolutionarily stable community for two cases: (1) all prey species have non-specific antipredator behaviour and (2) all prey species have predator-specific defence. Predator-specificity in defence increases community complexity, resource-overlap between predators, the total abundance of predators and the ratio of predator to prey abundance. Specific defence also decreases the number of isolated subwebs within the entire foodweb.},

	abstract = {Summary Weeds are major constraints on crop production, yet as part of the primary producers within farming systems, they may be important components of the agroecosystem. Using published literature, the role of weeds in arable systems for other above-ground trophic levels are examined. In the UK, there is evidence that weed flora have changed over the past century, with some species declining in abundance, whereas others have increased. There is also some evidence for a decline in the size of arable weed seedbanks. Some of these changes reflect improved agricultural efficiency, changes to more winter-sown crops in arable rotations and the use of more broad-spectrum herbicide combinations. Interrogation of a database of records of phytophagous insects associated with plant species in the UK reveals that many arable weed species support a high diversity of insect species. Reductions in abundances of host plants may affect associated insects and other taxa. A number of insect groups and farmland birds have shown marked population declines over the past 30 years. Correlational studies indicate that many of these declines are associated with changes in agricultural practices. Certainly reductions in food availability in winter and for nestling birds in spring are implicated in the declines of several bird species, notably the grey partridge, Perdix perdix. Thus weeds have a role within agroecosystems in supporting biodiversity more generally. An understanding of weed competitivity and the importance of weeds for insects and birds may allow the identification of the most important weed species. This may form the first step in balancing the needs for weed control with the requirements for biodiversity and more sustainable production methods.},

In grasses, infection with fungal endophytes can also have strong effects on insects, potentially modifying the effects of plant genetic diversity. We manipulated the genetic diversity and endophyte infection of a grass in a field experiment. We show that diversity of primary parasitoids (3rd trophic level) and, especially, secondary parasitoids (4th trophic level) increases with grass genetic diversity while there was no effect of endophyte infection. The increase in insect diversity appeared to be due to a complementarity effect rather than a sampling effect. The higher parasitoid diversity could not be explained by a cascading diversity effect because herbivore diversity was not affected and the same herbivore species were present in all treatments. The effects on the higher trophic levels must therefore be due to a direct response to plant traits or mediated by effects on traits at intermediate trophic levels.},

This usage distinguishes constancy from fixed preference or labile preference for the most rewarding flower type; I discuss a quantitative constancy index that is insensitive to preference changes. Because a constant visitor avoids flowers with acceptable rewards, the behavior is inefficient unless there are constraints such as an inability to learn quickly or to remember simultaneously how to deal with many flower types. If such constraints are the basis for constancy, it should be most pronounced when flowers in a mixture differ strongly in morphology or color. I observed bees foraging in outdoor flower arrays and found that constancy always increased with increasing differences among flower types; similar results can be gleaned from one other study. The available experimental evidence thus suggests that constancy reflects behavioral constraints.},

	abstract = {Human activities are causing rapid environmental change at a global scale. Urbanization is responsible for some of the most extreme human-altered habitats and is a known driver of evolutionary change, but evidence and understanding of these processes is limited. Here, we investigate the potential underlying mechanisms contributing to the contemporary evolution of migration behaviour in the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla). Blackcaps from central Europe have been wintering in urban areas of Britain with increasing frequency over the past 60 years, rather than migrating south to the Mediterranean. It has been hypothesized that the popularization of providing supplementary foods for wild birds within Britain may have influenced this marked migratory change, but quantifying the selective forces shaping evolutionary changes remains challenging. Using a long-term national scale data set, we examine both the spatial distribution and interannual variation in blackcap wintering behaviour in Britain in relation to supplementary food availability and local climate. Over a 12-year period, we show that blackcaps are becoming increasingly associated with the provision of supplementary foods in British gardens, and that the reliability of bird food supplies is influencing their winter distribution at a national scale. In addition, local climatic temperatures and broader scale weather variation are also important determinants of blackcap wintering patterns once they arrive in Britain. Based on our findings, we conclude that a synergistic effect of increased availability of feeding resources, in the form of garden bird food, coupled with climatic amelioration, has enabled a successful new wintering population to become established in Britain. As global biodiversity is threatened by human-induced environmental change, this study presents new and timely evidence of the role human activities can play in shaping evolutionary trajectories.},

	abstract = {Different species are of different importance in maintaining ecosystem functions in natural communities. Quantitative approaches are needed to identify unusually important or influential, ‘keystone’ species particularly for conservation purposes. Since the importance of some species may largely be the consequence of their rich interaction structure, one possible quantitative approach to identify the most influential species is to study their position in the network of interspecific interactions. In this paper, I discuss the role of network analysis (and centrality indices in particular) in this process and present a new and simple approach to characterizing the interaction structures of each species in a complex network. Understanding the linkage between structure and dynamics is a condition to test the results of topological studies, I briefly overview our current knowledge on this issue. The study of key nodes in networks has become an increasingly general interest in several disciplines: I will discuss some parallels. Finally, I will argue that conservation biology needs to devote more attention to identify and conserve keystone species and relatively less attention to rarity.},

	abstract = {In areas with intensive land use, such as the Netherlands, habitat fragmentation and loss of habitat quality due to eutrophication and drainage are major threats to the preservation of species-rich communities of heathland and acid grassland. Restoration of such nutrient-poor habitats may be carried out by removing the topsoil from ex-arable land, in order to lower the nutrient levels. However, the establishment of target plant communities is known to be fragmentary. The current study shows that this also applies to butterflies. Ten years after topsoil removal in eight study areas, on average, only 3.5 of 10 characteristic heathland species were recorded on the sites. Species that did colonize had a significantly lower density than in the source populations. Our study indicates that although isolation effects were limiting colonization, poor habitat quality was the main limiting factor, mainly due to lack of host plants, hydrological conditions, and, to a lesser extent, lack of nectar plants and excessive residual nutrient levels. An experiment with the introduction of cut heather in one study area showed a significantly higher abundance of both target and nontarget butterflies in manipulated sites than in control sites. It can be concluded that habitat restoration by topsoil removal can be successful for butterflies of especially wet heathland habitats, provided that source populations are at close range and care is taken that complete plant communities are restored.},

Here we show, using 40 years of data from the highly diverse mammal community of the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, that the primary cause of mortality for adults of a particular species is determined by two factors—the species diversity of both the predators and prey and the body size of that prey species relative to other prey and predators. Small ungulates in Serengeti are exposed to more predators, owing to opportunistic predation, than are larger ungulates; they also suffer greater predation rates, and experience strong predation pressure. A threshold occurs at prey body sizes of 150 kg, above which ungulate species have few natural predators and exhibit food limitation. Thus, biodiversity allows both predation (top-down) and resource limitation (bottom-up) to act simultaneously to affect herbivore populations. This result may apply generally in systems where there is a diversity of predators and prey.},

Beginning with Charles Elton's insights into food web structure, and continuing to contemporary ecologists and emerging areas of study, we highlight some of the most important empirical and theoretical advances made over the last century. The review highlights that there are fundamentally different ways in which food webs are depicted and studied. Specifically, when one views systems through mathematical, energy flow or functional lenses, very different perspectives on food web structure and dynamics emerge.

Habitat loss is considered the single greatest driver of species extinctions and amelioration of this threat through habitat restoration is increasingly important in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Success of restoration depends largely on the ability of species of a diversity of functional types to recolonize a restored site.



*
We used a restoration chronosequence to investigate the success of revegetation efforts (direct-seeding and tube stock methods) in returning species and trophic functions of trophically diverse ant assemblages to land formerly used for livestock grazing in south-eastern Australia. We examined assemblages based on: (i) species composition; (ii) trophic position and diversity, measured using stable isotopes of nitrogen; and (iii) species richness of trophic guilds based on δ15N isotopes (‘δ15N guilds’) and prior knowledge of diet (‘traditional trophic groups’).



*
Responses for δ15N trophic guilds were more distinct than for those based on traditional trophic groups.



*
Assemblage trophic position (mean species δ15N enrichment) decreased and trophic diversity (variance among species in δ15N enrichment) increased along the chronosequence from pastures to remnants. These patterns resulted from an increase in the richness of species with low δ15N enrichment (i.e. more ‘herbivorous’ species) along the chronosequence, which was also reflected in increases in the species richness of sugar feeders. Recovery of direct-seeded sites lagged behind tube stock sites of the same age, suggesting a role for habitat structure.



*
Species composition followed a trajectory suggestive of partial recovery, with revegetated sites supporting assemblages intermediate to pastures and remnants, but distinct from both.



*
Synthesis and applications. Tree planting promotes recovery of species composition and trophic function. Planting method affects the speed of functional recovery, although minimally. Species on the herbivorous end of the spectrum of omnivory were slower to recover than more predaceous species and may require deliberate restoration of features associated with mature trees. Trophic guilds based on objective measures of diet respond more clearly to restoration than do those based on subjective observations and offer a more insightful method.},

	abstract = {Ecological restoration of mined peatlands in North America involves active reintroduction of bog plant species. Animals are not actively reintroduced, thus the re-establishment of peatland fauna must occur either by inoculation along with introduced plant material or by dispersal. We examined the extent to which insects are reintroduced to restored sites with plant material by rearing insects from shredded vegetation collected in three donor sites. We assessed differences in abundance, diversity, and composition of taxonomic and trophic groups among seasons and sites. Abundance and species richness did not differ by season, but species assemblages did. The three sites were significantly different in abundance, but not in species richness and assemblages. Few insects emerged from the vegetation, suggesting that shredded plant material may not be the primary source of insect colonists. Insects likely recolonize by active or passive dispersal from the surrounding area. The species pool was similar among donor sites; consequently a mined site could be inoculated with vegetation from another peatland in the same region and this would not affect the insect assemblages at the initial stage of establishment. Diapause may be a major factor for emergence success among seasons of collection. Knowledge of how restoration techniques influence establishment of insect communities will help predict longer-term outcomes of restoration on biotic communities in peatlands.},

We show that differences in plant traits affect the structure of an entire food web through a series of direct and indirect effects. Three trophic levels of consumers were influenced by plant quality, as shown by quantitative herbivore–parasitoid–secondary parasitoid food webs. We conclude, on the basis of our data, that changes in the food web are dependent on both trait- and density-mediated interactions among species.},

Not only will the practice of restoration benefit from an increased focus on theory, but basic research in community ecology will also benefit. We pose several major thematic questions that are relevant to restoration from the perspective of community ecological theory and, for each, identify specific areas that are in critical need of further research to advance the science of restoration ecology. We ask, what are appropriate restoration endpoints from a community ecology perspective? The problem of measuring restoration at the community level, particularly given the high amount of variability inherent in most natural communities, is not easy, and may require a focus on restoration of community function (e.g., trophic structure) rather than a focus on the restoration of particular species. We ask, what are the benefits and limitations of using species composition or biodiversity measures as endpoints in restoration ecology? Since reestablishing all native species may rarely be possible, research is needed on the relationship between species richness and community stability of restored sites and on functional redundancy among species in regional colonist “pools.” Efforts targeted at restoring system function must take into account the role of individual species, particularly if some species play a disproportionate role in processing material or are strong interactors. We ask, is restoration of habitat a sufficient approach to reestablish species and function? Many untested assumptions concerning the relationship between physical habitat structure and restoration ecology are being made in practical restoration efforts. We need rigorous testing of these assumptions, particularly to determine how generally they apply to different taxa and habitats. We ask, to what extent can empirical and theoretical work on community succession and dispersal contribute to restoration ecology? We distinguish systems in which succession theory may be broadly applicable from those in which it is probably not. If community development is highly predictable, it may be feasible to manipulate natural succession processes to accelerate restoration. We close by stressing that the science of restoration ecology is so intertwined with basic ecological theory that practical restoration efforts should rely heavily on what is known from theoretical and empirical research on how communities develop and are structured over time.},

	abstract = {Many theoretical and empirical studies have shown that species diversity in a trophic level can impact the capture of limited resources in ways that cascade up or down a food web. Only recently, however, have ecologists begun to consider how diversity at multiple trophic levels might act in concert to have opposing or reinforcing effects on resource use. Here, we report the results of an empirical study of a model, tritrophic food web in which we manipulated the diversity of host plant species (Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense and Vicia faba) and natural enemy species (Harmonia axyridis, Coleomegilla maculata and Nabis sp.) of a widespread herbivorous pest (the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum) in laboratory microcosms. We found that increasing natural enemy richness from one to three species increased the proportion of aphids consumed by 0.14. This effect of enemy diversity was due to facilitative interactions and/or a reduction in intraspecific competition in the more diverse assemblages. We also found an independent and additive main effect of host plant richness, with the proportion of aphids consumed by natural enemies decreasing by 0.14 in plant polycultures. A reduction in predator efficiency on a single host plant, Vicia faba, appeared to be responsible for this plant diversity effect. Aphid population sizes were, therefore, simultaneously determined by a top-down effect of natural enemy diversity, and an opposing bottom-up effect of host plant diversity that modified enemy–prey interactions. These results suggest that population sizes in nature, and biotic controls over insect pests, are influenced by species diversity at multiple trophic levels.},

	abstract = {In ecology and biogeography it is often recognized that the species richness of different groups of organisms is spatially congruent (and thus positively correlated). However, ecological phenomena are often scale dependent and can change with spatial scale (i.e., grain size and extent). Because species richness gradients are also correlated with environmental gradients and plant species richness is thought to influence animal species richness, the relative roles of environment and plant richness in influencing cross-taxon congruence of animal richness at different spatial scales remain poorly explored. In this study, we examine the spatial concordance in species richness among terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants at two spatial grain sizes (local and regional) across China. We hypothesize that (H1) cross-taxon richness relationships are weaker at the local scale; (H2) climatic predictors of species richness are stronger at the regional scale; (H3) effects of habitat heterogeneity on species richness are stronger at the local scale; (H4) plant richness positively affects vertebrate richness after accounting for environmental effects; and (H5) the plant–vertebrate richness relationship is weaker at the regional scale. We found significant and positive correlations between species richness of the groups, with correlations being stronger at the regional scale than at the local scale (supporting H1). Climate has weaker effects on species richness at the regional scale than at the local scale (rejecting H2), and for vertebrates (but not for plants) effects of habitat heterogeneity are stronger at the local scale (supporting hypothesis H3). Plant richness positively affects vertebrate richness after accounting for environmental effects (supporting H4), but the effect is stronger for the two endothermic groups (mammals and birds) than for the two ectothermic groups (reptiles and amphibians). In contrast to hypothesis H5, the effect of plant richness on species richness of vertebrates is stronger at the regional scale than at the local scale. Our study suggests that plant richness has a significant influence on animal species richness across spatial scales and that the strength of the effects of plant species richness, climate, and topographic heterogeneity on animal species richness depends on the spatial grain size of sampling units.},

	abstract = {Species importance is often defined by how central the role a species plays in a food web. Here we argue that species importance should also incorporate the concept of uniqueness of its network position. By developing a previous methodology, we propose a new approach for species uniqueness. Our methodology quantifies the interaction structure of species, separates strong and weak interactors in a threshold-dependent way and measures the similarity of strong interactors’ identity for pairs of species. By exploring various threshold values systematically, the profile of a species’ trophic overlap can be constructed. Summing up the extent of trophic overlap across the whole profile for a species, we then obtain a new measure for species uniqueness. A unique species should overlap less with other species and therefore has a low value for this new measure. We demonstrate our methodology by using the food web representation of Prince Williams Sound ecosystem. Drastic differences between our new result and that derived from the previous approach are found. We further compare the result with other network indices and found that the information generated from our new approach differs from the majority others. This in turn implies our approach offer an alternative view on species importance that may complement the existing methodologies in the literature.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification threatens grasslands worldwide and the restoration of grasslands from arable lands can at least partially counter this threat. We studied grassland restoration by following early successional changes of arthropod assemblages (spiders, Araneae; true bugs, Heteroptera; orthopterans, Orthoptera; and ground beetles, Carabidae) on 1- and 2-year-old restorations using arable lands and native grasslands as two ends of the succession timescale. To examine the changes in species composition among the habitat types, we used habitat affinity indices based on fidelity and/or specificity of the species. We found that the number of species did not differ between habitat types, while species composition changed markedly with time. Species richness was thus not adequate to detect favorable changes after grassland restoration. Habitat affinity indices, on the other hand, were useful to detect compositional changes caused by the increasing numbers of species characteristic of target grasslands as early as the second year after restoration. Habitat affinity indices are easy-to-use, easy-to-interpret measures of restoration success; therefore, we recommend their use as measures complementary to species richness and simple similarity. Our results show that sowing low-diversity seed mixture followed by mowing and grazing can be particularly successful in grassland restoration in time periods as short as 2 years.},

Total species in 183 insect families on 127 vascular plant families were correlated with numbers of plant species in each family in Britain and Europe, accounting for 41.8\% of the variation. Families with trees had more insects, while ferns and aquatic, uncommon and ephemeral plants, particularly orchids, had fewer. Seven individual insect families were analysed separately: Aphididae were more closely correlated with plant species numbers than were the more polyphagous Geometridae. Agromyzidae were uncommon on families with trees. Of insect species 75.8\% fed on only one plant family and 10.1\% were recorded on two families. Species feeding on three families or more were considered to be polyphagous. In the 30 largest insect families, eight had species feeding on only one plant family, while 12 had more than 20\% of their species polyphagous. Proportions of family-restricted insects were high on Pinaceae, Gramineae and Compositae, but low on Corylaceae, Primulaceae and Tiliaceae. More pest species were polyphagous. Polyphagy was related to large larvae, larvae overwintering, wood-feeding, ephemeral food sources, poor dispersal abilities and omnivory. Some polyphagous species might be actively evolving in exploitation of vacant niches, leading to later progressive specialization to food-plants.},

	abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that phytophagous insects would have a strong top-down effect on early successional plant communities and would thus alter the course of succession. To test this hypothesis, we suppressed above-ground insects at regular intervals with a broad-spectrum insecticide through the first 3 years of old-field succession at three widely scattered locations in central New York State. Insect herbivory substantially reduced total plant biomass to a similar degree at all three sites by reducing the abundance of meadow goldenrod, Solidago altissima. As a result, Euthamia graminifolia dominated control plots whereas S. altissima dominated insecticide-treated plots by the third year of succession. S. altissima is the dominant old-field herbaceous species in this region but typically requires at least 5 years to become dominant. Past explanations for this delay have implicated colonization limitation whereas our data demonstrate that insect herbivory is a likely alternative explanation. A widespread, highly polyphagous insect, the xylem-tapping spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius, appeared to be the herbivore responsible for the reduction in standing crop biomass at all three sites. Insect herbivory typically caused little direct leaf tissue loss for the ten plant species we examined, including S. altissima. Consequently, the amount of leaf area removed was not a reliable indicator of the influence of insect herbivory on standing crop biomass or on early succession. Overall, we found a strong top-down effect of insect herbivores on biomass at several sites, so our results may be broadly applicable. These findings run counter to generalizations that top-down effects of herbivores, particularly insects, are weak in terrestrial systems. These generalizations may not apply to insects, such as spittlebugs, that can potentially mount an effective defense (i.e., spittle) against predators and subsequently reach relatively high abundance on common plant species. Our results suggest that insect herbivory may play an important but often overlooked role during early old-field succession.},

	abstract = {Abstract:   The role of diversity in the maintenance of ecosystems has been studied widely in the past decade. By correlating richness and diversity with basic ecosystem processes, these investigations lend support to the hypothesis that species diversity significantly influences ecosystem functioning and, in turn, provide support for the conservation of biodiversity. Nonetheless, the majority of these investigations demonstrate that conservation of a relatively small number of generally dominant species is sufficient to maintain most processes. Indeed, there is remarkably little evidence to support the contention that less common species, those likely of highest conservation concern, are important in the maintenance of ecosystem functioning. Here we summarize studies, most employing alternative methodological strategies, wherein less common and rare species are demonstrated to make significant contributions to ecosystem functioning. Evidence exists among studies of keystone species, aggregate effects of less common species, and species turnover. Our findings suggest that (1) less common species can make significant ecosystem contributions; (2) further investigation into the effects of rare and less common species on ecosystem maintenance is sorely needed; (3) further investigation should embrace a variety of approaches; and (4) until further research is conducted a prudent conservation approach is warranted wherein the contribution of less common species to ecosystem functioning is assumed.},

	abstract = {The greater susceptibility of higher trophic levels to habitat loss has been demonstrated to disrupt important trophic interactions such as consumer control of prey populations. This pattern is predicted to break down for generalist species that can use matrix habitats, yet empirical studies comparing generalist and specialist enemy pressure in response to natural habitat loss are lacking. Here we examined the effects of landscape simplification resulting from habitat conversion to agriculture on nettles, Urtica dioica, their specialized aphid herbivore, Microlophium carnosum, and associated natural enemies that varied broadly in their degree of specialization. Both nettles and their specialized aphid herbivore were significantly more abundant in complex than simple landscapes. Different enemy groups showed contrasting responses. Aphid specialists (parasitic wasps and cecidomyiid midges) reached higher densities in complex than simple landscapes, and this effect was primarily related to shifts in local resource abundance (i.e. nettle aphid densities). In contrast, densities of generalists (coccinellid beetles and spiders) were significantly higher in simple landscapes, presumably due to spillover of generalists from surrounding cropland habitats. Natural enemy-prey ratios did not differ significantly across landscape types for specialist groups but were significantly higher in simple than complex landscapes for generalist groups, suggesting that enemy pressure on nettle aphids likely increases with landscape simplification. This was supported by our finding that aphid population growth rates were lower in simple than complex landscapes, and declined significantly with increasing coccinellid densities. Thus, in marked contrast to previous work, our results suggest that natural habitat loss may augment rather than disrupt consumer–prey interactions, and this will depend greatly on the degree of specialization of functionally dominant natural enemies.},

	abstract = {Predicting the consequences of species loss requires extending our traditional understanding of simpler dynamic systems of few interacting species to the more complex ecological networks found in natural ecosystems. Especially important is the scaling up of our limited understanding of how and under what conditions loss of ‘keystone’ species causes large declines of many other species. Here we explore how these keystone effects vary among simulations progressively scaled up from simple to more complex systems. Simpler simulations of four to seven interacting species suggest that species up to four links away can strongly alter keystone effects and make the consequences of keystone loss potentially indeterminate in more realistically complex communities. Instead of indeterminacy, we find that more complex networks of up to 32 species generally buffer distant influences such that variation in keystone effects is well predicted by surprisingly local ‘top-down’, ‘bottom-up’, and ‘horizontal‘ constraints acting within two links of the keystone subsystem. These results demonstrate that: (1) strong suppression of the competitive dominant by the keystone may only weakly affect subordinate competitors; (2) the community context of the target species determines whether strong keystone effects are realized; (3) simple, measurable, and local attributes of complex communities may explain much of the empirically observed variation in keystone effects; and (4) increasing network complexity per se does not inherently make the prediction of strong keystone effects more complicated.},

	abstract = {The majority of species of flowering plants rely on pollination by insects, so that their reproductive success and in part their population structure are determined by insect behaviour. The foraging behaviour of insect pollinators is flexible and complex, because efficient collection of nectar or pollen is no simple matter. Each flower provides a variable but generally small reward that is often hidden, flowers are patchily distributed in time and space, and are erratically depleted of rewards by other foragers. Insects that specialise in visiting flowers have evolved an array of foraging strategies that act to improve their efficiency, which in turn determine the reproductive success of the plants that they visit. This review attempts a synthesis of the recent literature on selectivity in pollinator foraging behaviour, in terms of the species, patch and individual flowers that they choose to visit.

The variable nature of floral resources necessitate foraging behaviour based upon flexible learning, so that foragers can respond to the pattern of rewards that they encounter. Fidelity to particular species allows foragers to learn appropriate handling skills and so reduce handling times, but may also be favoured by use of a search image to detect flowers. The rewards received are also used to determine the spatial patterns of searches; distance and direction of flights are adjusted so that foragers tend to remain within rewarding patches and depart swiftly from unrewarding ones. The distribution of foragers among patchy resources generally conforms to the expectations of two simple optimal foraging models, the ideal free distribution and the marginal value theorem.

Insects are able to learn to discriminate among flowers of their preferred species on the basis of subtle differences in floral morphology. They may discriminate upon the basis of flower size, age, sex or symmetry and so choose the more rewarding flowers. Some insects are also able to distinguish and reject depleted flowers on the basis of ephemeral odours left by previous visitors. These odours have recently been implicated as a mechanism involved in interspecific interactions between foragers.

From the point of view of a plant reliant upon insect pollination, the behaviour of its pollinators (and hence its reproductive success) is likely to vary according to the rewards offered, the size and complexity of floral displays used to advertise their location, the distribution of conspecific and of rewards offered by other plant species, and the abundance and behaviour of other flower visitors.},

With concerns of a global pollination crisis, there is a need for improving pollinator habitat. Roadsides restored to native prairie vegetation may provide valuable habitat to bees, the most important group of pollinators. Such roadsides support a variety of pollen and nectar sources and unlike agricultural fields, are unplowed, and therefore can provide potential nesting sites for ground-nesting bees. To examine potential effects of roadside restoration, bee communities were sampled via aerial netting and pan trapping along roadside prairie restorations as well as roadsides dominated by non-native plants. Management of roadside vegetation via the planting of native species profoundly affected bee communities. Restored roadsides supported significantly greater bee abundances as well as higher species richness compared to weedy roadsides. Floral species richness, floral abundance, and percentage of bare ground were the factors that led to greater bee abundance and bee species richness along restored roadsides. Traffic and width of roadside did not significantly influence bees, suggesting that even relatively narrow verges near heavy traffic could provide valuable habitat to bees. Restored and weedy roadside bee communities were similar to the prairie remnant, but the prairie remnant was more similar in bee richness and abundance to restored roadsides. Restoring additional roadsides to native vegetation could benefit pollinator conservation efforts by improving habitat on the millions of acres of land devoted to roadsides worldwide, land that is already set aside from further development.},

In floristically diverse regions, restoring all plant species following anthropogenic disturbance is financially costly and it is unknown if this can be achieved. However, re-creating faunal habitat may not require reinstating all plant species if there is a high degree of redundancy. Here, we assess whether there is redundancy among a subset of native plant species chosen to restore fauna habitat following a severe disturbance. Additionally, we determine if reestablished plants support similar faunal assemblages as the same plant species in less disturbed forest. We sampled plant-dwelling Hemiptera from 1,800 plants across 16 species. We found 190 species of Hemiptera, with most plant species in the forest having distinct hemipteran assemblages. Returning these plant species to areas undergoing restoration reinstated 145 hemipteran species, including the dominant species. Recalcitrant plant species (difficult to propagate and reestablish in restored areas) had different hemipteran assemblages from all other species. There was only one plant species that did not have a distinct assemblage and thus was considered redundant. We conclude that there is little redundancy in this study. For plant-dwelling Hemiptera (with good powers of dispersal) to recolonize restored areas, restoration efforts will need to reinstate at least 13 of the 16 species of host plant of appropriate age and structure. Consequently, to meet the goal of restoring fauna habitat when there is no knowledge of which plant species are redundant, restoration projects should aim to reinstate all plant species present in less disturbed reference areas.},

We established different management regimes along an experimental gradient of plant species richness within “The Jena-Experiment” in Germany and quantified herbivory as well as grasshoppers and pollinators. Herbivory, grasshopper density and species richness and frequency of flower visiting pollinators were recorded two times in each of four subplots of altogether 80 plots differing in plant species richness. Each of the four subplots was subject to four different levels of fertilizer application and mowing to simulate very low, low, high and very high land use intensity.

Fertilization and mowing significantly affected plant–herbivore interactions but plant species richness had no discernible effect. Grasshoppers were most abundant at high intensity subplots (3.1 individuals per m2) and least abundant on very low intensity subplots (1.3 individuals per m2). Leaf damage caused by herbivores was highest in even the very high intensity subplots (3.7\%) with four mowing events per year and high amounts of fertilizer application and lowest on subplots with a low management intensity (2.4\%) comprising two mowing events per year but no fertilizer application. In contrast, pollinators benefited most from lower management intensities, with only one or two mowing events and no fertilizer addition. In addition, higher numbers of flowering plant species and increased blossom cover was associated with enhanced pollinator species richness and flower visitation.

Our results indicate that even in grasslands with high plant species richness, mowing and fertilization are more important drivers of herbivory and flower visitation by pollinators. Management with no more than two cuts per year and without fertilizer application in our grasslands balanced the ecosystem functions of increased pollination and decreased herbivory.},

However, the combined effects of these different factors remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to unravel the causes of variations in the standing biomass of plant communities using a long-term experiment conducted in a Mediterranean rangeland of Southern France. Two management regimes, sheep grazing and grazing associated with mineral fertilization, were applied to different areas of the study site over the past 25 years. Abiotic (temperature, available water, nutrients) and biotic (components of the functional structure communities) factors were considered to explain interannual and spatial variations in standing biomass in these rangelands. Standing biomass was highly predictable, with the best model explaining ∼80\% of variations in the amount of biomass produced, but the variation explained by abiotic and biotic factors was dependent on the season and on the management regime. Abiotic factors were found to have comparable effects in both management regimes: The amount of biomass produced in the spring was limited by cold temperatures, while it was limited by water availability and high temperatures in the summer. In the fertilized community, the progressive change in the functional structure of the communities had significant effects on the amount of biomass produced: the dominance of few productive species which were functionally close led to higher peak standing biomass in spring.},

This unanswered question originated with the idea of ecological niches, and yet bears relevance today for understanding what determines network structure. Here, we analyse a set of 200 ecological networks, including food webs, antagonistic and mutualistic networks, and find that the number of dimensions needed to completely explain all interactions is small ( {\textless} 10), with model selection favouring less than five. Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations. These results link ecologically important species attributes to large-scale community structure.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity surrogates and indicators are commonly used in conservation management. The focal species approach (FSA) is one method for identifying biodiversity surrogates, and it is underpinned by the hypothesis that management aimed at a particular focal species will confer protection on co-occurring species. This concept has been the subject of much debate, in part because the validity of the FSA has not been subject to detailed empirical assessment of the extent to which a given focal species actually co-occurs with other species in an assemblage. To address this knowledge gap, we used large-scale, long-term data sets of temperate woodland birds to select focal species associated with threatening processes such as habitat isolation and loss of key vegetation attributes. We quantified co-occurrence patterns among focal species, species in the wider bird assemblage, and species of conservation concern. Some, but not all, focal species were associated with high levels of species richness. One of our selected focal species was negatively associated with the occurrence of other species (i.e., it was an antisurrogate)—a previously undescribed property of nominated focal species. Furthermore, combinations of focal species were not associated with substantially elevated levels of bird species richness, relative to levels associated with individual species. Our results suggest that although there is some merit to the underpinning concept of the FSA, there is also a need to ensure that actions are sufficiently flexible because management tightly focused on a given focal species may not benefit some other species, including species of conservation concern, such of which might not occur in species-rich assemblages.

Here, we introduce the concept of keystone communities (and ecosystems) within metacommunities (and metaecosystems). We define keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a ‘keystoneness’ axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness. We suggest that the concept of keystone communities/ecosystems will be highly beneficial, not only as a fundamental step towards understanding species interactions in a spatial context, but also as a tool for the management of disturbed landscapes.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the structure of ecological networks and community stability has been studied for decades. Recent developments highlighted that this relationship depended on whether interactions were antagonistic or mutualistic. Different structures promoting stability in different types of ecological networks, i.e. mutualistic or antagonistic, have been pointed out. However, these findings come from studies considering mutualistic and antagonistic interactions separately whereas we know that species are part of both types of networks simultaneously. Understanding the relationship between network structure and community stability, when mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are merged in a single network, thus appears as the next challenge to improve our understanding of the dynamics of natural communities. Using a theoretical approach, we test whether the structural characteristics known to promote stability in networks made of a single interaction type still hold for network merging mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We show that the effects of diversity and connectance remain unchanged. But the effects of nestedness and modularity are strongly weakened in networks combining mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. By challenging the stabilizing mechanisms proposed for networks with a single interaction type, our study calls for new measures of structure for networks that integrate the diversity of interaction.},

	abstract = {Understanding the functional impacts of pollinator species losses on plant populations is critical given ongoing pollinator declines. Simulation models of pollination networks suggest that plant communities will be resilient to losing many or even most of the pollinator species in an ecosystem. These predictions, however, have not been tested empirically and implicitly assume that pollination efficacy is unaffected by interactions with interspecific competitors. By contrast, ecological theory and data from a wide range of ecosystems show that interspecific competition can drive variation in ecological specialization over short timescales via behavioral or morphological plasticity, although the potential implications of such changes in specialization for ecosystem functioning remain unexplored. We conducted manipulative field experiments in which we temporarily removed single pollinator species from study plots in subalpine meadows, to test the hypothesis that interactions between pollinator species can shape individual species’ functional roles via changes in foraging specialization. We show that loss of a single pollinator species reduces floral fidelity (short-term specialization) in the remaining pollinators, with significant implications for ecosystem functioning in terms of reduced plant reproduction, even when potentially effective pollinators remained in the system. Our results suggest that ongoing pollinator declines may have more serious negative implications for plant communities than is currently assumed. More broadly, we show that the individual functional contributions of species can be dynamic and shaped by the community of interspecific competitors, thereby documenting a distinct mechanism for how biodiversity can drive ecosystem functioning, with potential relevance to a wide range of taxa and systems.},

Abstract
Insect outbreaks in forest and agriculture monocultures led Charles Elton to propose, a half-century ago, that higher plant diversity stabilized animal foodweb dynamics in natural ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis by studying arthropod community dynamics in a long-term experimental manipulation of grassland plant species diversity. Over the course of a decade, we found that higher plant diversity increased the stability (i.e. lowered year-to-year variability) of a diverse ({\textgreater}700 species) arthropod community across trophic levels. As the number of plant species increased, the stability of both herbivore and predator species richness and of total herbivore abundance increased. The underlying mechanisms driving these diversity–stability relationships were plant diversity, via effects on primary productivity and plant community stability, and portfolio effects. Taken together, our results show that higher plant diversity provides more temporally consistent food and habitat resources to arthropod foodwebs. Consequently, actively managing for high plant diversity may have stronger than expected benefits for increasing animal diversity and controlling pest outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Various entities have been designated keystone resources, but few tests have been attempted and we are unaware of any experimental manipulations of purported keystone resources. Mistletoes (Loranthaceae) provide structural and nutritional resources within canopies, and their pervasive influence on diversity led to their designation as keystone resources. We quantified the effect of mistletoe on diversity with a woodland-scale experiment, comparing bird diversities before and after all mistletoe plants were removed from 17 treatment sites, with those of 11 control sites and 12 sites in which mistletoe was naturally absent. Three years after mistletoe removal, treatment woodlands lost, on average, 20.9 per cent of their total species richness, 26.5 per cent of woodland-dependent bird species and 34.8 per cent of their woodland-dependent residents, compared with moderate increases in control sites and no significant changes in mistletoe-free sites. Treatment sites lost greater proportions of birds recorded nesting in mistletoe, but changes in species recorded feeding on mistletoe did not differ from control sites. Having confirmed the status of mistletoe as a keystone resource, we suggest that nutrient enrichment via litter-fall is the main mechanism promoting species richness, driving small-scale heterogeneity in productivity and food availability for woodland animals. This explanation applies to other parasitic plants with high turnover of enriched leaves, and the community-scale influence of these plants is most apparent in low productivity systems.},

	abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {Is formal science necessarily an effective framework and methodology for designing and implementing ecological restoration programs? My experience as an ecologist in Hawaii suggests that even when scientific research programs are explicitly designed to guide and facilitate restoration, the culture of science, heterogeneity of nature, and real-world complexities of implementing land management practices often limit the practical relevance of conventional scientific research. Although alternative models such as adaptive management and transdisciplinary science may facilitate research that more robustly models the real world, there is often little professional support or incentive to orient even these nonconventional research approaches toward actually solving on-the-ground problems. Thus, if one’s goal is to accomplish ecological restoration as quickly and efficiently as possible, a trial-and-error/intelligent tinkering–type approach might often be better than using more rigorous, data-intensive scientific methodology. However, the sympatric implementation of ecological restoration and scientific research programs can lead to valuable synergies such as mutual logistical and financial support and the exchange of distinct forms of knowledge. The professional activities and mere presence of scientists can also greatly enhance a program’s prestige and visibility, which in turn can indirectly promote more and better ecological restoration. Improving our understanding of when formal science can directly assist restoration projects and when its value will more likely be synergistic and indirect could lead to better science, better ecological restoration, and better relationships between these two cultures.},

Restored landfill sites are a significant potential reserve of semi-natural habitat, so their conservation value for supporting populations of pollinating insects was here examined by assessing whether the plant and pollinator assemblages of restored landfill sites are comparable to reference sites of existing wildlife value. Floral characteristics of the vegetation and the species richness and abundance of flower-visiting insect assemblages were compared between nine pairs of restored landfill sites and reference sites in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, using standardized methods over two field seasons. No differences were found between the restored landfill and reference sites in terms of species richness or abundance of plants in flower and both types of site had similar assemblages of pollinators. However, plant and insect assemblages differed across the season, with species richness and abundance being lower for the restored landfill sites in the spring and higher in the autumn compared to the reference sites. The results indicate that in this region, landfill sites are being restored to a state comparable to that of the reference sites with regards to their provision of floral resources and the associated insect pollinator assemblages. Since there are currently 2,200 working landfill sites in England and Wales, covering 28,000 ha, and closing at a rate of 100 per year, this is potentially a significant reserve of land that could be restored.},

We tested effects of revegetation of grazing land formerly vegetated by eucalyptus woodland on trophic groups of epigaeic beetles, considering a restoration chronosequence (space-for-time substitution). We used paddocks (i.e. grazed pastures) as the start point, sites in two age classes (5–8 and 12–17 since years since replanting) and fenced woodland remnants to represent the desired end point. Phytophages were most common in young revegetated sites, which had reduced grazing pressure and low canopy cover. Assemblage composition of both saprophages and predators converged on those of remnants over “time”. Paddock sites had the lowest species evenness of saprophages, with two species being particularly common. Saprophage assemblages in paddocks were also more homogeneous than those in other site types i.e. between site variation in assemblage composition was low. Predators were smaller but more species-rich in sites with less coarse woody debris, canopy cover and litter, possibly responding to higher abundances of small prey. Beetle biomass did not differ across habitats. For saprophages, a greater abundance in paddocks was counterbalanced by reduced body size. Remnants did not support a significantly greater proportion of habitat-specific species. However, more species than expected were specific to treed sites. Our study supports previous findings that habitat structure is a key driver of beetle community restoration. It also suggests that epigaeic assemblages respond relatively rapidly to revegetation, probably because they do not require resources that develop over long periods of time. The similarities in biomass for all trophic groups across sites suggest that beetle-performed functions may operate similarly in different stages, reflecting high functional resilience of epigaeic beetle assemblages in this landscape.},

Abstract
Community assembly history is increasingly recognized as a fundamental determinant of community structure. However, little is known as to how assembly history may affect ecosystem functioning via its effect on community structure. Using wood-decaying fungi as a model system, we provide experimental evidence that large differences in ecosystem functioning can be caused by small differences in species immigration history during community assembly. Direct manipulation of early immigration history resulted in three-fold differences in fungal species richness and composition and, as a consequence, differences of the same magnitude in the rate of decomposition and carbon release from wood. These effects – which were attributable to the history-dependent outcome of competitive and facilitative interactions – were significant across a range of nitrogen availabilities observed in natural forests. Our results highlight the importance of considering assembly history in explaining ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is rapidly declining, and this may negatively affect ecosystem processes, including economically important ecosystem services. Previous studies have shown that biodiversity has positive effects on organisms and processes across trophic levels. However, only a few studies have so far incorporated an explicit food-web perspective. In an eight-year biodiversity experiment, we studied an unprecedented range of above- and below-ground organisms and multitrophic interactions. A multitrophic data set originating from a single long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights that would not be gained from meta-analysis of different experiments. Here we show that plant diversity effects dampen with increasing trophic level and degree of omnivory. This was true both for abundance and species richness of organisms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs. Both above ground and below ground, herbivores responded more strongly to changes in plant diversity than did carnivores or omnivores. Density and richness of carnivorous taxa was independent of vegetation structure. Below-ground responses to plant diversity were consistently weaker than above-ground responses. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen infestation and hyperparasitism. Our results suggest that plant diversity has strong bottom-up effects on multitrophic interaction networks, with particularly strong effects on lower trophic levels. Effects on higher trophic levels are indirectly mediated through bottom-up trophic cascades.},

	abstract = {As part of a restoration project, multiple genotypes of two tree species, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii), and one shrub species, Coyote willow (S. exigua), were experimentally planted in different proportions at the Palo Verde Ecological Reserve near Blythe, California, U.S.A. These common woody plant species are important to the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher, providing perch, nesting, and foraging habitat. We conducted this study to evaluate plant species proportion and plant genotype effects on the arthropod community, the prey base for the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. Three patterns emerged. First, plant species proportions were important; the arthropod community had the greatest richness and diversity (H′) when Goodding's willow proportion was high and Fremont cottonwood proportion was lower; that is, fewer Fremont cottonwoods are required to positively affect overall arthropod diversity. Second, we found significant genotypic effects, for all three plant species, on arthropod species accumulation. Third, while both planting proportion and genotype effects were significant, we found that the effect of planting proportion on arthropod richness was about twice as large as the effect of plant genotype. This shows that both plant species proportions and genotype should be utilized in restoration projects to maximize habitat heterogeneity and arthropod richness. Similar studies can determine which planting proportion and specific genotypes may result in a more favorable arthropod prey base for the southwestern willow flycatcher and other species of concern. Greater attention to planting design and genotype can result in significant gains in diversity at little or no additional project cost.},

Experiments indicate that in many communities only a few species will have such strong effects, whereas most will have weak effects owing to small per capita effects and/or low abundance,,. But extinction of these 'weak' interactors could significantly alter natural communities because they play important stabilizing or 'noise-dampening' roles,,. I demonstrate here that some 'weak' interactors may also be important by magnifying spatiotemporal variation in community structure. An analysis of published interaction strength data shows that the greatest variation in species effect occurred for the weakest interactions. A field experiment corroborates this and shows how indirect interactions can generate an inverse relationship between the mean and variance of a consumer's impact on its prey. When a species' effects are highly variable in sign and magnitude, they may average to seem weak over broad scales but be strong in local contexts. Thus, what is frequently considered to be 'noise' in species interaction data may be a critical part of the signal.},

Scope The aim in this paper is to offer an overview of the mechanisms influencing the structure of plant–animal mutualistic networks. A brief summary is presented of the salient network patterns, the potential mechanisms are discussed and the studies that have evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows that researchers of plant–animal mutualisms have made substantial progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts on selected representative study systems throughout the world.},

	abstract = {Pollinators provide essential ecosystem services, and declines in some pollinator communities around the world have been reported. Understanding the fundamental components defining these communities is essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We examined the structure of plant–pollinator communities in a dynamic Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity. Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental factors govern the community. Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities at various levels: (1) The overall structure of the bee community (116 species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age. (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on age-characteristic post-fire floral community structure explained 39–50\% of overall variation observed in bee community structure. Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of similarity in their species composition (27–59\%); however, the geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but significant component to bee community structure. We conclude that floral resources act in specific and previously unexplored ways to modulate the diversity of the local geographic species pool, with specific disturbance factors, superimposed upon these patterns, mainly affecting the dominant species.},

	abstract = {The composition of communities is strongly altered by anthropogenic manipulations of biogeochemical cycles, abiotic conditions, and trophic structure in all major ecosystems. Whereas the effects of species loss on ecosystem processes have received broad attention, the consequences of altered species dominance for emergent properties of communities and ecosystems are poorly investigated. Here we propose a framework guiding our understanding of how dominance affects species interactions within communities, processes within ecosystems, and dynamics on regional scales. Dominance (or the complementary term, evenness) reflects the distribution of traits in a community, which in turn affects the strength and sign of both intraspecific and interspecific interactions. Consequently, dominance also mediates the effect of such interactions on species coexistence. We review the evidence for the fact that dominance directly affects ecosystem functions such as process rates via species identity (the dominant trait) and evenness (the frequency distribution of traits), and indirectly alters the relationship between process rates and species richness. Dominance also influences the temporal and spatial variability of aggregate community properties and compositional stability (invasibility). Finally, we propose that dominance affects regional species coexistence by altering metacommunity dynamics. Local dominance leads to high beta diversity, and rare species can persist because of source—sink dynamics, but anthropogenically induced environmental changes result in regional dominance and low beta diversity, reducing regional coexistence. Given the rapid anthropogenic alterations of dominance in many ecosystems and the strong implications of these changes, dominance should be considered explicitly in the analysis of consequences of altered biodiversity.},

	abstract = {* Despite extensive development of successional theory, few empirical studies have evaluated whether existing models are applicable to human-modified landscapes. Seasonally dry tropical forests are experiencing widespread transformation, and represent a critical system to assess in a successional framework to infer the mechanisms that shape assembly of secondary forests post-management.


* We used a functional trait-based approach to assess changes in community assembly mechanisms along a successional gradient in secondary dry forests of varying stages following abandonment of cattle activity. Nearby old-growth forests served as an undisturbed comparison. We evaluated whether re-assembly proceeded consistent with existing theory, in early successional stages via habitat filtering, leading to reduced trait range, and via competitive exclusion in later stages, leading to increased trait evenness. Using three orthogonal traits and two functional diversity indices we tested for evidence of assembly mechanisms along resource axes that may be particularly important to dry forest systems, dynamic changes in habitat filtering and competitive exclusion, and potential legacy effects of management.


* We found little support of a progression from habitat filtering to competitive exclusion, with the exception of dispersion patterns for specific leaf area and multi-variate functional richness. Water availability may underlie species sorting in most stages, as evidenced by range reduction in wood density, and might be a resource particularly important to dry forest assembly. Early successional stages displayed an unexpected pattern of low evenness, which may be due to initial stand composition including remnants and resprouts, a regeneration strategy typical to dry forest species. Beyond influencing initial conditions, management legacy was apparent in advanced secondary forests, which differed in range, even dispersion, and functional richness from old-growth forests, suggesting the operation of different assembly mechanisms.


* The departures from expectations suggest the need to re-assess successional models to include effects of management legacies on the operation of community assembly mechanisms in human-modified landscapes, as well as characteristics that distinguish wet and dry forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {* 1Organic farming is thought to lead to increased biodiversity and greater sustainability than higher-yielding conventional farming systems. It is usually assumed that organic farms have both larger and higher quality areas of semi-natural habitats, although this assumption has not been unequivocally tested.
* 2Here we test the hypothesis that in comparison to conventional farms, organic farms have larger areas of semi-natural and boundary vegetation, and organic farms support higher levels of plant abundance, richness and diversity within cropped and semi-natural areas.
* 3Our study compared whole-farms: 10 organic farms were paired with 10 conventional farms in a complex landscape in the south-west of England. On average, organic farms were 7·3 years post conversion. Plant abundance, species richness and diversity were measured in all crop and non-crop landscape elements on each farm.
* 4Organic farms had greater total areas of semi-natural habitat (woodland, field margins and hedgerows combined). Woodland area on it's own was also significantly greater. Organic farms had more continuous blocks of woodland (with simpler perimeters than similarly sized patches on conventional farms), whereas woodland on conventional farms often consisted of more linear patches.
* 5Semi-natural habitats on organic farms did not have higher plant abundance, richness or diversity than their conventional counterparts. The only landscape element that showed a significant increase in plant abundance, richness or diversity was arable fields.
* 6Synthesis and applications. Even within a complex agricultural landscape differences do exist between organic and conventional farms, these differences being larger areas of semi-natural habitats on organic farms. However, with the exception of arable fields, no habitats on organic farms were yet of a better quality than their conventional counterparts in terms of plant abundance and diversity. Conventional farmers may be able to achieve an increase in plant diversity within arable fields by adopting some organic management practices at the field scale (e.g. exclusion of synthetic herbicides), and whole-farm conversion to organic practice might not be required. However, further work is needed to determine any biodiversity benefits of larger areas of semi-natural habitat on conventional farmland.},

In this study, we use mathematical models to explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that modulate the explanatory power of phylogenetic information for communities of species that interact within a single trophic level. We find that phylogenetic relationships among species can influence trait evolution and rates of interaction among species, but only under particular models of species interaction. For example, when interactions within communities are mediated by a mechanism of phenotype matching, phylogenetic trees make specific predictions about trait evolution and rates of interaction. In contrast, if interactions within a community depend on a mechanism of phenotype differences, phylogenetic information has little, if any, predictive power for trait evolution and interaction rate. Together, these results make clear and testable predictions for when and how evolutionary history is expected to influence contemporary rates of species interaction.},

We measured herbivore damage on seminatural grassland plots planted with 1, 2, 4, 8, or 12 plant species, and compared plant biomass in a subset of these plots with replicates in which insect levels were reduced. Plant biomass and herbivore damage increased with species richness. Reducing insect populations resulted in greater evenness of relative plant species abundances and revealed a strong positive relationship between plant species richness and above-ground biomass. Reducing insects also changed the relationship between plant species richness and decomposition. Plant species mixtures and their relative abundances partially explained plant biomass results, but not decomposition results. These results suggest that insects can alter relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem processes through all three mechanisms.},

Non-trivial differences are shown in link distribution frequencies between species-rich and species-poor communities, which might have important consequences for the responses of ecosystems to disturbances. Coarse-grained topological properties observed, as species richness-connectance and number of links-species richness relationships, provide no support for the theory of links-species scaling law or constant connectance across empirical food webs investigated. We further explore these observations by means of simulated food webs resulting from multitrophic assembly models using different functional responses between species. Species richness-connectance and links-species richness relationships of empirical food webs are reproduced by our models, but degree distributions are not properly predicted, suggesting the need of new theoretical approximations to food web assembly. The best agreement between empirical and simulated webs occurs for low values of interaction strength between species, corroborating previous empirical and theoretical findings where weak interactions govern food web dynamics.},

Are the relationships between traits and performance consistent across the functional groups of annual forbs, perennial forbs and grasses? Do the relationships between traits and performance depend on neighboring functional groups? Location:  A former agricultural field, being restored to native upland prairie, in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon, USA. Methods:  Twenty-eight native species, representing three functional groups, were sown in seven different combinations. Eleven functional traits were measured from plants in the laboratory and in the field. Correlations between individual traits and performance variables were measured and regression techniques used to determine which sets of traits were most strongly related to performance. Results:  Sets of traits explained up to 56\% of variation in cover, and up to 48\% of variation in establishment frequency. The relationships between traits and performance were influenced by functional group identity; the functional group identity of neighboring species also influenced species' cover and the relationships between traits and cover. Species' establishment rate in monoculture was the trait most strongly correlated to both establishment and cover in mixtures. In multi-trait models, annual forb functional group identity was strongly related to establishment in mixtures, and height, leaf weight ratio at 7 d and seed mass were strongly related to cover. Conclusions:  Multiple-trait models should be a useful way of predicting the performance of species prior to sowing in restoration. The functional group identity of each species and the other species being sown may need to be taken into account when making predictions.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an @'observer@' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

We investigated recovery of terrestrial arthropod assemblages in conjunction with restoration of a montane wet meadow in Sequoia National Park (Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.A.). Our goal was to assess response of arthropod assemblages to wetland restoration in this winter-dominated environment, including comparison of faunal reassembly in (1) areas of sparse plugs (planted over several years) and (2) dual-density plantings with additional heterogeneity, complexity, and connectance to source habitats provided by high-density bands running through sparsely planted habitat (final study year only). Results across all restoration treatments indicated varying levels of faunal reassembly, but convergence of faunal assemblages with reference habitat had not occurred after recovery periods as long as 5 years. Similarity indices and multivariate compositional results indicated a slower recovery than did univariate trends for assemblage metrics and abundances for some individual taxa, highlighting the utility of assessments using a range of taxa and analytical approaches. Faunal recovery did not appear to lag behind that of vegetation structure, despite the short growing season. The dual-density plantings indicated faster recovery after 1 year, across almost all metrics, than was observed after several years for the sparse plantings. Restoration configurations that increase habitat complexity, heterogeneity, and/or connectance may disproportionately increase rates of passive faunal reassembly and prove to be cost-effective approaches for promoting recovery of ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Most emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans have arisen from animals. Identifying high-risk hosts is therefore vital for the control and surveillance of these diseases. Viewing hosts as connected through the parasites they share, we use network tools to investigate predictors of parasitism and sources of future EIDs. We generated host–parasite networks that link hosts when they share a parasite, using nonhuman primates as a model system because—owing to their phylogenetic proximity and ecological overlap with humans—they are an important source of EIDs to humans. We then tested whether centrality in the network of host species—a measurement of the importance of a given node (i.e., host species) in the network—is associated with that host serving as a potential EID source. We found that centrality covaries with key predictors of parasitism, such as population density and geographic range size. Importantly, we also found that primate species having higher values of centrality in the primate–parasite network harbored more parasites identified as EIDs in humans and had parasite communities more similar to those found in humans. These relationships were robust to the use of different centrality metrics and to multiple ways of controlling for variation in how well each species has been studied (i.e., sampling effort). Centrality may therefore estimate the role of a host as a source of EIDs to humans in other multispecific host–parasite networks.},

	abstract = {The ways in which natural selection can allow the proliferation of cooperative behavior have long been seen as a central problem in evolutionary biology. Most of the literature has focused on interactions between pairs of individuals and on linear public goods games. This emphasis has led to the conclusion that even modest levels of migration would pose a serious problem to the spread of altruism through population viscosity in group structured populations. Here we challenge this conclusion, by analyzing evolution in a framework which allows for complex group interactions and random migration among groups. We conclude that contingent forms of strong altruism that benefits equally all group members, regardless of kinship and without greenbeard effects, can spread when rare under realistic group sizes and levels of migration, due to the assortment of genes resulting only from population viscosity. Our analysis combines group-centric and gene-centric perspectives, allows for arbitrary strength of selection, and leads to extensions of Hamilton’s rule for the spread of altruistic alleles, applicable under broad conditions.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.},

	abstract = {Habitat restoration has become an important part of biodiversity conservation in the face of extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, especially in agricultural landscapes. Study of invertebrates such as beetles (Coleoptera) may be important to assess the effectiveness of restoration techniques in maintaining native fauna, because they provide a variety of trophic roles and ecosystem services. In this study we examined the conservation value for beetles of revegetation in linear strips and alongside remnant patches compared with remnant vegetation and cleared roadsides. We also assessed how habitat variables structured beetle community composition. Beetle species richness and abundance did not substantially differ between revegetated, remnant and cleared areas, and was not substantially influenced by vegetation type and structure. Herbivorous beetles and the family Curculionidae were more species rich in cleared linear strips. Beetle fauna in these agricultural landscapes may be a robust subset of the pre-clearing beetle community, possibly due to the widespread degradation of remnant areas and the ground layer habitats within them. One beetle species had slightly higher abundance in remnant linear strips, suggesting that remnant habitats may be important for some beetle species. Importantly, environmental variables strongly influenced beetle community composition, signifying that beetle communities are still responding to factors such as soil type and native vegetation, rather than variables mainly associated with land management. The restoration practices currently being undertaken in agricultural areas may not maintain beetle species that require specific habitat variables to survive. Ground-layer attributes need to be included in future revegetation projects, and translocation of specialist species of beetles may be required to restore communities.},

This was investigated in seven plant–hummingbird assemblages on the West Indian islands of Grenada, Dominica and Puerto Rico. We report all hummingbird and insect pollinators of 49 hummingbird-pollinated plant species, as well as six quantitative and semi-quantitative floral characters that determine visitor restriction, attraction and reward. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis, we show that hummingbird-pollinated plants in the West Indies separate in floral phenotypic space into two gradients—one associated with the abiotic environment and another with hummingbird size. Plants pollinated by large, long-billed hummingbirds had flowers with long corolla tube, large amounts of nectar and showy orange-red colouration. These attracted few or no insect species, whereas plants pollinated by small, short-billed hummingbirds were frequently pollinated by insects, particularly lepidopterans. The separation of plants related to environmental factors showed that species in the wet and cold highlands produced large amounts of dilute nectar, possessed no or a weak odour, and were associated with few insects, particularly few hymenopterans, compared to plants in the dry and warm lowlands. The most specialised hummingbird-pollinated plants are found in the West Indian highlands where they are pollinated by mainly large, long-billed hummingbirds. At the other extreme, highly generalised plants growing in the dry and warm lowlands are pollinated by small, short-billed hummingbirds and numerous insect species. This illustrates that, even within the hummingbird-pollinated flora, pollination syndrome and the degree of specialisation may vary tremendously depending on pollinator morphology and environment.},

We took advantage of ongoing invasions by a suite of exotic species to examine their impact in terms of the disassembly of an interaction web in Patagonia, Argentina. We found that the reduction of one species (a host of a keystone mistletoe species) resulted in diverse indirect effects that led to the disassembly of an interaction web through the loss of the mistletoe, two key seed-dispersers (a marsupial and a bird), and a pollinator (hummingbird). Our results demonstrate that the gains and losses of species are both consequences and drivers of global change that can lead to underappreciated cascading coextinctions through the disruption of mutualisms.},

	abstract = {* 1Related plant species with different spatial and/or temporal life-history characteristics often possess differences in secondary chemistry and thus direct defensive capability. These differences are often attributed to a range of divergent selection pressures from herbivores and pathogens. Most studies of insect–plant interactions have examined the effects of plant defence on herbivore performance, with less attention being paid to higher trophic levels, such as parasitoid wasps. Moreover, to date it is not known whether secondary plant compounds may affect organisms in the fourth trophic level.
* 2Here, we study interactions in a four-trophic-level system. The development of a solitary secondary hyperparasitoid, Lysibia nana, and its primary endoparasitoid host, Cotesia glomerata, are compared when reared from a primary herbivore host, Pieris brassicae, which was itself reared on two cruciferous plants with contrasting life histories. Whereas L. nana is known to attack the pupae of a number of primary parasitoids in the genus Cotesia, both C. glomerata and P. brassicae are intimately associated with plants in the family Brassicaceae.
* 3Insects were reared from a feral population of the spring perennial, Brassica oleracea, and a naturally occurring population of a summer annual, B. nigra. Like other cruciferous plants, both species are known to produce glycoside toxins (= glucosinolates) after they are attacked by foliar herbivores. However, concentrations of glucosinolates were more than 3·5 times higher in young shoots of B. nigra than in corresponding shoots of B. oleracea.
* 4Cocoon weight in C. glomerata was unaffected by the foodplant on which P. brassicae was reared, whereas in 24-h-old host cocoons emerging adult hyperparasitoid body mass increased significantly with cocoon size and wasps were significantly larger, and survived better on B. oleracea than on B. nigra. Moreover, body mass in L. nana was typically larger in young (c. 24 h), than in older (c. 72 h) cocoons of C. glomerata. Egg-to-adult development time in L. nana generally increased with host size and age, and wasps on younger hosts completed their development more rapidly on B. nigra.
* 5Our results clearly demonstrate that qualitative differences in herbivore diet can differently affect the performance of interacting organisms across several trophic levels, and suggest that bottom-up forces may also play a role in mediating interactions involving plants–herbivores–parasitoids and hyperparasitoids.},

Visitation and pollen transport networks were constructed to compare replicated I. glandulifera invaded and I. glandulifera removal plots. Invaded plots had significantly higher visitor species richness, visitor abundance and flower visitation. However, the pollen transport networks were dominated by alien pollen grains in the invaded plots and consequently higher visitation may not translate in facilitation for pollination. The more generalized insects were more likely to visit the alien plant, and Hymenoptera and Hemiptera were more likely to visit the alien than Coleoptera.

	abstract = {Creation of ecological networks is advocated to increase the viability of regional populations and their resilience to climatic and land-use change with associated habitat fragmentation and loss. However, management of network elements should be appropriate for the regional biota conserved, requiring evidence from multiple taxa. We examined the response of carabids, spiders, ants and vascular plants, to six physical disturbance treatments ranging in intensity plus controls, replicated across 63 plots in a plantation trackway network of a heathland region in England. Over 2 years, 73,182 invertebrates from 256 species were identified and 23,241 observations of 222 vascular plant species made.

Abundance and richness of stenotopic carabids and plants (respectively associated with heath and dune, or unshaded physically-disturbed low-nutrient soils) increased with disturbance intensification. Ant assemblages were similar among treatments and control plots, only differing from heathland sites through addition of generalist species. Spider assemblages were less resilient; overall abundance and richness reduced with greater disturbance. Generalist spiders recovered in year two, although incompletely in the most intensely disturbed treatment. Contrasting responses among taxonomic groups likely reflect differences in dispersal ability.

Treatments that merely disrupted vegetation quickly regained plant cover and height, suggesting frequent reapplication will be required to maintain heath specialist species. Turf stripping, the most severe treatment, was quickly colonised by specialist carabid and plant species. Treatments that are more durable may allow stenotopic spider assemblages to develop in contrast to shorter-lived treatments. Effectiveness of early-successional habitat networks within regions supporting European lowland heathland will be enhanced by physical disturbance and turf stripping. Our results emphasise the importance of examining multiple taxonomic groups when assessing management outcomes.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the restoration of chalk grasslands over a 6-year period and tests the efficacy of two management practices, hay spreading and soil disturbance, in promoting this process for phytophagous beetles. Restoration success for the beetles, measured as similarity to target species–rich chalk grassland, was not found to be influenced by either management practice. In contrast, restoration success for the plants did increase in response to hay spreading management. Although the presence of suitable host plants was considered to dictate the earliest point at which phytophagous beetles could successfully colonized, few beetle species colonized as soon as their host plants became established. Morphological characteristics and feeding habits of 27 phytophagous beetle species were therefore tested to identify factors that limited their colonization and persistence. The lag time between host plant establishment and colonization was greatest for flightless beetles. Beetles with foliage-feeding larvae both colonized at slower rates than seed-, stem-, or root-feeding species and persisted within the swards for shorter periods. Although the use of hay spreading may benefit plant communities during chalk grassland restoration, it did not directly benefit phytophagous beetles. Without techniques for overcoming colonization limitation for invertebrate taxa, short-term success of restoration may be limited to the plants only.},

	abstract = {While many studies have demonstrated that organic farms support greater levels of biodiversity, it is not known whether this translates into better provision of ecosystem services. Here we use a food-web approach to analyse the community structure and function at the whole-farm scale. Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of organic and conventional farms showed that organic farms have significantly more species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and significantly different network structure. Herbivores on organic farms were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service. The explanation for these differences is likely to include inherent differences in management strategies and landscape structure between the two farming systems.},

We report results of a direct experimental test of the dependence of animal diversity on plant diversity. We sampled arthropods in a well‐replicated grassland experiment in which plant species richness and plant functional richness were directly manipulated. In simple regressions, both the number of species planted ( \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},\_\{2\}\$ transformed) and the number of functional groups planted significantly increased arthropod species richness but not arthropod abundance. However, the number of species planted was the only significant predictor of arthropod species richness when both predictor variables were included in ANOVAs or a MANOVA. Although highly significant, arthropod species richness regressions had low \$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ values, high intercepts (24 arthropod species in monocultures), and shallow slopes. Analyses of relations among plants and arthropod trophic groups indicated that herbivore diversity was influenced by plant, parasite, and predator diversity. Furthermore, herbivore diversity was more strongly correlated with parasite and predator diversity than with plant diversity. Together with regression results, this suggests that, although increasing plant diversity significantly increased arthropod diversity, local herbivore diversity is also maintained by, and in turn maintains, a diversity of parasites and predators.},

We experimentally separated the effects of primary productivity and herbivores of different body size on plant species richness across a 10-fold productivity gradient using a 7-year field experiment at seven grassland sites in North America and Europe. We show that assemblages including large herbivores increased plant diversity at higher productivity but decreased diversity at low productivity, while small herbivores did not have consistent effects along the productivity gradient. The recognition of these large-scale, cross-site patterns in herbivore effects is important for the development of appropriate biodiversity conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Studies of host specificity in tropical insect herbivores are evolving from a focus on insect distribution data obtained by canopy fogging and other mass collecting methods, to a focus on obtaining data on insect rearing and experimentally verified feeding patterns. We review this transition and identify persisting methodological problems. Replicated quantitative surveys of plant–herbivore food webs, based on sampling efforts of an order of magnitude greater than is customary at present, may be cost-effectively achieved by small research teams supported by local assistants. Survey designs that separate historical and ecological determinants of host specificity by studying herbivores feeding on the same plant species exposed to different environmental or experimental conditions are rare. Further, we advocate the use of host‐specificity measures based on plant phylogeny. Existing data suggest that a minority of species in herbivore communities feed on a single plant species when alternative congeneric hosts are available. Thus, host plant range limits tend to coincide with those of plant genera, rather than species or suprageneric taxa. Host specificity among tropical herbivore guilds decreases in the sequence: granivores{\textgreater}leaf-miners{\textgreater}fructivores{\textgreater}leaf-chewers=sap-suckers{\textgreater}xylophages{\textgreater}root-feeders, thus paralleling patterns observed in temperate forests. Differences in host specificity between temperate and tropical forests are difficult to assess since data on tropical herbivores originate from recent field studies, whereas their temperate counterparts derive from regional host species lists, assembled over many years. No major increase in host specificity from temperate to tropical communities is evident. This conclusion, together with the recent downward revisions of extremely high estimates of tropical species richness, suggest that tropical ecosystems may not be as biodiverse as previously thought.},

	abstract = {The influence of space on the structure (e.g. modularity) of complex ecological networks remains largely unknown. Here, we sampled an individual-based plant–pollinator network by following the movements and flower visits of marked bumblebee individuals within a population of thistle plants for which the identities and spatial locations of stems were mapped in a 50 × 50 m study plot. The plant–pollinator network was dominated by parasitic male bumblebees and had a significantly modular structure, with four identified modules being clearly separated in space. This indicated that individual flower visitors opted for the fine-scale division of resources, even within a local site. However, spatial mapping of network modules and movements of bumblebee individuals also showed an overlap in the dense center of the plant patch. Model selection based on Akaike information criterion with traits as predictor variables revealed that thistle stems with high numbers of flower heads and many close neighbours were particularly important for connecting individuals within the modules. In contrast, tall plants and those near the patch center were crucial for connecting the different modules to each other. This demonstrated that individual-based plant–pollinator networks are influenced by both the spatial structure of plant populations and individual-specific plant traits. Additionally, bumblebee individuals with long observation times were important for both the connectivity between and within modules. The latter suggests that bumblebee individuals will still show locally restricted movements within sub-patches of plant populations even if they are observed over a prolonged time period. Our individual-based and animal-centered approach of sampling ecological networks opens up new avenues for incorporating foraging behaviour and intra-specific trait variation into analyses of plant–animal interactions across space.},

	abstract = {Supergeneralists, defined as species that interact with multiple groups of species in ecological networks, can act as important connectors of otherwise disconnected species subsets. In Brazil, there are two supergeneralist bees: the honeybee Apis mellifera, a non-native species, and Trigona spinipes, a native stingless bee. We compared the role of both species and the effect of geographic and local factors on networks by addressing three questions: 1) Do both species have similar abundance and interaction patterns (degree and strength) in plant-bee networks? 2) Are both species equally influential to the network structure (nestedness, connectance, and plant and bee niche overlap)? 3) How are these species affected by geographic (altitude, temperature, precipitation) and local (natural vs. disturbed habitat) factors? We analyzed 21 plant-bee weighted interaction networks, encompassing most of the main biomes in Brazil. We found no significant difference between both species in abundance, in the number of plant species with which each bee species interacts (degree), and in the sum of their dependencies (strength). Structural equation models revealed the effect of A. mellifera and T. spinipes, respectively, on the interaction network pattern (nestedness) and in the similarity in bee’s interactive partners (bee niche overlap). It is most likely that the recent invasion of A. mellifera resulted in its rapid settlement inside the core of species that retain the largest number of interactions, resulting in a strong influence on nestedness. However, the long-term interaction between native T. spinipes and other bees most likely has a more direct effect on their interactive behavior. Moreover, temperature negatively affected A. mellifera bees, whereas disturbed habitats positively affected T. spinipes. Conversely, precipitation showed no effect. Being positively (T. spinipes) or indifferently (A. mellifera) affected by disturbed habitats makes these species prone to pollinate plant species in these areas, which are potentially poor in pollinators.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the structure of a multispecific network of interacting ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries recorded in 1990 and again in 2000 in La Mancha, Veracruz, Mexico. We assessed the replicability of the number of interactions found among species and also whether there had been changes in the network structure associated with appearance of new ant and plant species during that 10-year period. Our results show that the nested topology of the network was similar between sampling dates, group dissimilarity increased, mean number of interactions for ant species increased, the frequency distribution of standardized degrees reached higher values for plant species, more ant species and fewer plant species constituted the core of the more recent network, and the presence of new ant and plant species increased while their contribution to nestedness remained the same. Generalist species (i.e., those with the most links or interactions) appeared to maintain the stability of the network because the new species incorporated into the communities were linked to this core of generalists. Camponotus planatus was the most extreme generalist ant species (the one with the most links) in both networks, followed by four other ant species; but other species changed either their position along the continuum of generalists relative to specialists or their presence or absence within the network. Even though new species moved into the area during the decade between the surveys, the overall network structure remained unmodified.},

This study explores interactions over three trophic levels, from the third (primary parasitoid) to the fourth (secondary parasitoid) and terminating in the fifth (tertiary parasitoid).
* 2Host utilization and adult body mass of the secondary and tertiary parasitoid Gelis agilis was determined when developing on pre-pupae of its primary parasitoid host, Cotesia glomerata, and from pre-pupae of another secondary parasitoid, Lysibia nana that had developed initially on pre-pupae of C. glomerata.
* 3In both C. glomerata and G. agilis, the body mass of emerging adult parasitoids was strongly positively correlated with initial cocoon mass. For a given cocoon mass at parasitism, emerging adult G. agilis wasps were almost 90\% as large as C. glomerata adults developing in healthy cocoons of comparable mass. Furthermore, G. agilis adults were still 75\% as large as C. glomerata adults even when developing on L. nana that in turn had developed on C. glomerata. Otherwise, in terms of adult body mass per unit of host resources, there was no apparent difference in the quality of C. glomerata or L. nana hosts for the development of G. agilis.
* 4Analyses of carbon and nitrogen in body tissues of the parasitoids over the third to the fifth trophic level revealed that percentage nitrogen was higher and carbon lower in G. agilis and L. nana than in C. glomerata. Furthermore, percentage carbon was lower in adult G. agilis wasps that had developed from L. nana than from C. glomerata.
* 5We argue that the remarkable efficiency which characterizes the development of secondary and tertiary parasitoids is based on the very high nutritional quality of resources that increase in quality up the food chain and rigid selection optimizing allocation of limited host resources. Consequently, food webs involving secondary and tertiary parasitoids can go to levels hitherto unexplored thus far in empirical studies. The use of molecular markers in future studies may reveal just how long food chains involving these insects may extend.},

To have the best chance of discovering common properties though, networks should be constructed using a standardized approach. However, this is rarely the case, and pollination networks are constructed using two main methods: transects and timed observations. To investigate the potential for variation in network structure arising from different construction techniques we constructed plant–pollinator networks using two different methods at a single site, repeating our protocol over three field seasons. Transects and timed observation methods differ in the evenness of observation effort allocated among plant species in the observed community. We show that the uneven allocation of observation effort significantly affects the number of unique interactions in the network, and we reveal a strong trend in effects on web asymmetry and evenness of marginal abundance distributions. However, these effects do not appear to extend to the higher-order properties of connectance and nestedness.},

We show that in real food webs, interaction strengths are organized in trophic loops in such a way that long loops contain relatively many weak links. We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum “loop weight” and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities.},

Modules are link-dense regions of the network where species interact more closely within the module than between modules of the network. Insufficient network resolution has meant that modules have proved difficult to identify, even though they appear important in the propagation of disturbance impacts. We applied a standardized approach across 20 farms to obtain well-resolved food webs to characterize network structure and explore how modularity changes in response to management (organic and conventional). All networks showed significantly higher modularity than random networks. Farm management had no effect on the number of modules per farm or module richness, but there was a significant loss of links between modules on conventional farms, which may affect the long-term stability of these networks. We found a significant association between modules and major habitat groups. If modules form as a result of interactions between species that utilize similar habitats, then ecosystem services to the crop components of the landscape, such as pest control by parasitoids originating in the non-crop vegetation, are less likely to occur on these farms.},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in floral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks.},

This phenomenon, coined here ‘interaction release’, has been previously reported for single species but never for an entire community. During 4 years, we gathered data on bird–flower visitation on 12 Galápagos islands. We show that all sampled land birds exploit floral resources and act as potential pollinators across the entire archipelago, in all major habitats and all year round. Although species and link composition varies among islands, strong interaction release takes place on all islands, making their bird–flower network highly generalized. Interaction release is crucial to the survival of native birds but simultaneously threatens the unique biodiversity of this archipelago, as the birds also visit invading plants, likely facilitating their integration into pristine native communities.},

	abstract = {A contemporary goal in both ecology and evolutionary biology is to develop theory that transcends the boundary between the two disciplines, to understand phenomena that cannot be explained by either field in isolation. This is challenging because macroevolution typically uses lineage-based models, whereas ecology often focuses on individual organisms. Here, we develop a new parsimonious individual-based theory by adding mild selection to the neutral theory of biodiversity. We show that this model generates realistic phylogenies showing a slowdown in diversification and also improves on the ecological predictions of neutral theory by explaining the occurrence of very common species. Moreover, we find the distribution of individual fitness changes over time, with average fitness increasing at a pace that depends positively on community size. Consequently, large communities tend to produce fitter species than smaller communities. These findings have broad implications beyond biodiversity theory, potentially impacting, for example, invasion biology and paleontology.},

A systematic review approach is applied to investigate the evidence from peer reviewed and grey literature on the effectiveness of PAs focusing on two outcomes: (a) habitat cover and (b) species populations. We only include studies that causally link conservation inputs to outcomes against appropriate counterfactuals. From 2599 publications we found 76 studies from 51 papers that evaluated impacts on habitat cover, and 42 studies from 35 papers on species populations. Three conclusions emerged: first, there is good evidence that PAs have conserved forest habitat; second, evidence remains inconclusive that PAs have been effective at maintaining species populations, although more positive than negative results are reported in the literature; third, causal connections between management inputs and conservation outcomes in PAs are rarely evaluated in the literature. Overall, available evidence suggests that PAs deliver positive outcomes, but there remains a limited evidence base, and weak understanding of the conditions under which PAs succeed or fail to deliver conservation outcomes.},

Rarely considered in understanding size–diversity relationships is the history of community assembly. I conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment with freshwater protists and rotifers to test for interactive effects of assembly history and ecosystem size on species diversity. The experiment used a two-way factorial design with four assembly sequences and four ecosystem sizes as treatments. Community dynamics were monitored for about 50–100 generations. The results show that history affected diversity more strongly in smaller ecosystems, presumably owing to greater priority effects. Consequently, history determined when diversity was significantly related to ecosystem size. The results also suggest that long-term transient community dynamics can make assembly history important for community structuring even in the absence of alternative stable states. Because species immigration is essentially stochastic, ecosystem size is variable, and priority effects can be strong in many natural systems, the history × size interaction revealed in this study also has the potential to shape natural size–diversity patterns.},

Density-dependent processes involving pests and pathogens, for example, have been invoked to account for plant community phylogenetic patterns, but relatively little is known about how plant relatedness might affect community structure at other trophic levels. We examined the degree to which the abundance of herbivores in a rain forest community is explained by the phylogeny and functional traits of host plants. We destructively sampled all stems ≥5 cm diameter in two 1-ha plots of New Guinea primary and secondary lowland forest to test predicted relationships between herbivore abundance and plant resources. We analyzed per-tree caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, total leaf biomass (kg), percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area (cm2/g), leaf nitrogen content (percentage of dry mass), and presence of exudates in the context of a plant community phylogeny estimated from DNA barcodes. Apart from nitrogen content and exudates, neither plant resources nor herbivore abundance showed evidence of phylogenetic signal in our community sample. The plant traits we measured could account for only 30\% and 16\% of variation in caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, respectively, among individual trees. Leaf biomass was a stronger predictor of herbivore abundance than either resource quality (leaf nitrogen content) or palatability (percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area). The primary importance of resource quantity was also observed at the plant species level in analyses of species means and phylogenetic generalized least-squares regression. Plant relatedness did not account for much variation in herbivore abundance, but significant effects of exudates and leaf nitrogen content on caterpillar abundance illustrate how conserved traits at one trophic level may influence community-wide patterns at another.},

	abstract = {* Most plant–pollinator network studies are conducted at species level, whereas little is known about network patterns at the individual level. In fact, nodes in traditional species-based interaction networks are aggregates of individuals establishing the actual links observed in nature. Thus, emergent properties of interaction networks might be the result of mechanisms acting at the individual level.


* Pollen loads carried by insect flower visitors from two mountain communities were studied to construct pollen–transport networks. For the first time, these community-wide pollen–transport networks were downscaled from species–species (sp–sp) to individuals–species (i–sp) in order to explore specialization, network patterns and niche variation at both interacting levels. We used a null model approach to account for network size differences inherent to the downscaling process. Specifically, our objectives were (i) to investigate whether network structure changes with downscaling, (ii) to evaluate the incidence and magnitude of individual specialization in pollen use and (iii) to identify potential ecological factors influencing the observed degree of individual specialization.


* Network downscaling revealed a high specialization of pollinator individuals, which was masked and unexplored in sp–sp networks. The average number of interactions per node, connectance, interaction diversity and degree of nestedness decreased in i–sp networks, because generalized pollinator species were composed of specialized and idiosyncratic conspecific individuals. An analysis with 21 pollinator species representative of two communities showed that mean individual pollen resource niche was only c. 46\% of the total species niche.


* The degree of individual specialization was associated with inter- and intraspecific overlap in pollen use, and it was higher for abundant than for rare species. Such niche heterogeneity depends on individual differences in foraging behaviour and likely has implications for community dynamics and species stability.


* Our findings highlight the importance of taking interindividual variation into account when studying higher-order structures such as interaction networks. We argue that exploring individual-based networks will improve our understanding of species-based networks and will enhance the link between network analysis, foraging theory and evolutionary biology.},

However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67\% to 96\% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78\% in temperate-zone communities to 94\% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5\% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant–pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {* The degradation of the Andean cloud forest raises strong biological conservation issues and threatens the sustainability of a crucial water resource. The idea that nurse-based restoration can accelerate the recovery of these forests is underexplored, despite its promise as a restoration technique. Recent conceptual models predict that facilitation among plants may be an important mechanism, but there is a lack of strong empirical support. We gathered experimental data to test this prediction and explore the relevance of using nurse-based forest restoration in these environments.


* A 20-month factorial experimental design in the Andean tropical cloud forest was established. We measured the survival and estimated the biomass production of transplanted seedlings of a keystone canopy forest species, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae), in a deforested area in the presence/absence of herbivory, a potential nurse plant (the tussock grass Setaria sphacelata, Poaceae) and artificial shade.


* The joint effects of deforestation and herbivory led to the death of all seedlings, whereas most seedlings survived in the adjacent forest, which was used as the control. The presence of nurse plants led to significantly higher survival and growth of Ceroxylon seedlings throughout the experiment, regardless of herbivore presence.


* The nurse effects were explained by a reduction of the relative abiotic stress experienced by the seedlings outside the forest, that is, the consistently decreasing maximum vapour pressure deficit. Furthermore, nurse tussocks delayed and reduced the effects of herbivory by offering physical protection and a refuge for seedlings against detection by herbivores. However, the effects of herbivory and abiotic stress on facilitation were not additive.


* Synthesis and applications. Facilitation in degraded cloud forest can be intense as soon as the beneficiary plants are driven away from their physiological optimum (relative abiotic stress) and/or are confronted by herbivory. Using pre-established exotic tussock grasses as a nurse-based restoration technique in degraded cloud forest is a low-cost, non-detrimental (to biodiversity) option, especially in the absence of nurse trees and shrubs. The success of this method requires transplanting seedlings at the base of tussocks.},

	abstract = {Most flowering plants depend on pollinators to reproduce. Thus, evaluating the robustness of plant-pollinator assemblages to species loss is a major concern. How species interaction patterns are related to species sensitivity to partner loss may influence the robustness of plant-pollinator assemblages. In plants, both reproductive dependence on pollinators (breeding system) and dispersal ability may modulate plant sensitivity to pollinator loss. For instance, species with strong dependence (e.g. dioecious species) and low dispersal (e.g. seeds dispersed by gravity) may be the most sensitive to pollinator loss. We compared the interaction patterns of plants differing in dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability in a meta-dataset comprising 192 plant species from 13 plant-pollinator networks. In addition, network robustness was compared under different scenarios representing sequences of plant extinctions associated with plant sensitivity to pollinator loss. Species with different dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability showed similar levels of generalization. Although plants with low dispersal ability interacted with more generalized pollinators, low-dispersal plants with strong dependence on pollinators (i.e. the most sensitive to pollinator loss) interacted with more particular sets of pollinators (i.e. shared a low proportion of pollinators with other plants). Only two assemblages showed lower robustness under the scenario considering plant generalization, dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability than under the scenario where extinction sequences only depended on plant generalization (i.e. where higher generalization level was associated with lower probability of extinction). Overall, our results support the idea that species generalization and network topology may be good predictors of assemblage robustness to species loss, independently of plant dispersal ability and breeding system. In contrast, since ecological specialization among partners may increase the probability of disruption of interactions, the fact that the plants most sensitive to pollinator loss interacted with more particular pollinator assemblages suggest that the persistence of these plants and their pollinators might be highly compromised.},

Pitfall trap and sweep net sampling were used to assess invertebrate communities from six low- and six high-diversity plantings. Our results did not clearly demonstrate that terrestrial invertebrate assemblages respond better to high-diversity plantings than low-diversity plantings. There was no difference in total abundance, family richness, or diversity of invertebrates between the plantings. Composition of invertebrate communities was similar between plantings. Araneae and Acrididae were the only major taxa that differed in abundances between plantings. Similarity of invertebrate communities in plantings is likely attributed to lack of plant architectural complexity, absence of host-plants, and time-lag effects in high-diversity plantings. Because recovery time of high-diversity plantings lagged considerably behind low-diversity plantings, invertebrate communities in high-diversity plantings were likely to be in early stages of development, but will likely become more diverse and abundant as the planting matures. Consequently, our results emphasize the need for long-term monitoring of invertebrate and plant communities in grassland restorations. Additionally, discrepancies in types and abundances of captured invertebrates between pitfall trapping and sweep netting emphasizes the need to use more than one sampling method when using invertebrates to monitor and assess restoration success.},

	abstract = {This study quantifies the invertebrate fauna found on broom, Cytisus scoparius, L. (Link), in two countries where it grows as a native plant (France and England) and two countries where it grows as an alien plant (New Zealand and Australia). The data are used to test three hypotheses concerning the predicted differences in invertebrate community structure in native versus exotic habitats: (1) Are generalist phytophages dominant in exotic habitats and specialist phytophages dominant in native habitats? (2) Are there empty phytophage niches in exotic habitats? (3) As a plant species accumulates phytophages, do these in turn accumulate natural enemies? The broom fauna was sampled at five sites in each country by beating five broom bushes per site. The sampling efficiency of beating was quantified at one field site and it was shown to collect 87 \% of invertebrate abundance, 95 \% of invertebrate biomass and 100 \% of phytophagous species found on the branches. Generalist phytophages were dominant on broom in exotic habitats and specialists dominant on broom in the native habitats. Thus, the two countries where broom grows as a native plant had higher numbers of total phytophage species and a higher abundance of specialist phytophages per bush. There was no significant difference in the average abundance of generalist phytophage species found per bush in native and alien habitats. Phytophages were assigned to seven feeding niches: suckers, root feeders, external chewers, flower feeders, seed feeders, miners and pollen feeders. Empty niches were found in the exotic habitats; species exploiting structurally specific parts of the host plant, such as flowers and seeds, were absent in the countries where broom grows as an alien plant. The pattern of niche occupancy was similar between native and exotic habitats when just the generalist phytophages were considered. As phytophage abundance and biomass increased, there were concomitant increases in natural enemy abundance and biomass. Thus, it appears that as plants accumulate phytophages, the phytophages in turn accumulate natural enemies and a food web develops around the plant. Moreover, in the native countries, the history of association between the natural enemies and their prey has been sufficient for specialist predators and parasitoids, feeding on the specialist phytophages, to have evolved.},

	abstract = {Fire suppression has altered the uplands of northern Mississippi (U.S.A.). Once blanketed by open oak woodlands, this region is now experiencing mesophytic tree invasion, canopy closure, reduced oak regeneration, and herbaceous understory loss. In an attempt to reestablish historical conditions, experimental restoration was initiated through thinning and burning treatments. Our study, part of a comprehensive monitoring effort, is the first to examine the impact of oak woodland restoration on the spider community and associated habitat structure. Samples measuring a variety of environmental variables and utilizing an array of spider collecting techniques were taken within four habitats located at the restoration site: fire-suppressed forest, moderately treated forest, intensely treated forest, and old field. Two main conclusions resulted from this study. (1) Open-habitat specialists responded positively to increased canopy openness regardless of the availability of herbaceous vegetation. (2) Woodland restoration increased spider diversity, perhaps through the formation of diverse habitat structure and/or by altering species dominance patterns. A rise in open-habitat specialist diversity was observed as treatment intensity increased, with no compensatory reduction in the diversity of forest specialists. What remains to be seen is whether the continued transition to open woodland habitat will result in losses of forest specialist species. More aggressive overstory tree thinning is currently being administered to encourage the growth of herbaceous grasses and forbs, which will permit future tests of a hypothesized decline in forest specialists.},

We sampled such multiple networks simultaneously in an agroecosystem. We show that the networks varied in their robustness; networks including pollinators appeared to be particularly fragile. We show that, overall, networks did not strongly covary in their robustness, which suggests that ecological restoration (for example, through agri-environment schemes) benefitting one functional group will not inevitably benefit others. Some individual plant species were disproportionately well linked to many other species. This type of information can be used in restoration management, because it identifies the plant taxa that can potentially lead to disproportionate gains in biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y−1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y−1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

We monitored the use of sucrose feeders by foragers in free-flying colonies that had either multiple patrilines or a single patriline as the feeders were sequentially stocked, emptied, and then restocked. Multiple-patriline colonies tended to have more inspectors than single-patriline colonies, their inspectors inspected their feeder at higher rates when it was empty, and then foraged at higher rates and performed more waggle runs when it was restocked, which quadrupled feeder recruitment. The patriline profile for a colony’s inspectors consistently differed from that of its general population. We show clear ergonomic benefits of extreme polyandry for honey bee queens and their colonies.},

	abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities are structured by both deterministic, niche-based processes and stochastic processes such as dispersal. A pressing issue in ecology is to determine when and for which organisms each of these types of processes is important in community assembly. The roles of deterministic and stochastic processes have been studied for a variety of communities, but very few researchers have addressed their contribution to insect herbivore community structure. Insect herbivore niches are often described as largely shaped by the antagonistic pressures of predation and host plant defenses. However host plants are frequently discrete patches of habitat, and their spatial arrangement can affect herbivore dispersal patterns. We studied the roles of predation, host plant quality, and host spatial proximity for the assembly of a diverse insect herbivore community on Quercus alba (white oak) across two growing seasons. We examined abundances of feeding guilds to determine if ecologically similar species responded similarly to variation in niches. Most guilds responded similarly to leaf quality, preferring high-nitrogen, low-tannin host plants, particularly late in the growing season, while bird predation had little impact on herbivore abundance. The communities on the high-quality plants tended to be larger and, in some cases, have greater species richness. We analyzed community composition by correlating indices of community similarity with predator presence, leaf quality similarity, and host plant proximity. Birds did not affect community composition. Community similarity was significantly associated with distance between host plants and uncorrelated with leaf quality similarity. Thus although leaf quality significantly affected the total abundance of herbivores on a host plant, in some cases leading to increased species richness, dispersal limitation may weaken this relationship. The species composition of these communities may be driven by stochastic processes rather than variation in host plant characteristics or differential predation by insectivorous birds.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanisms that shape biodiversity is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interacting species. Recent studies posit that most of the organization of mutualistic networks is shaped by differences in species abundance among interacting species. In this study, we examined the mutualism involving plants with extrafloral nectaries and their associated ants. We show empirically that the difference in abundance among ants on vegetation partially explains the network structure of mutualistic interactions and that it is independent of ant species compositions: an ant species that is abundant usually interacts with more plant species. Moreover, nested networks are generated by simple variation in ant abundance on foliage. However, in ant–plant mutualistic networks, nestedness was higher than in networks describing the occurrence of ants on plants without a food resource. Additionally, the plant and ant species with the highest number of interactions within these networks interacted more among themselves than expected under the assumption of an abundance-based, random mixing of individuals. We hypothesize that the dominance of these ant species occurs because these ants are able to outcompete other ant species when feeding on extrafloral nectaries and because of the presence of ecophysiological adaptations to utilize liquid food.},

	abstract = {At the beginning of the 20th century, many montane heathlands were abandoned and became subject to natural succession or afforestation by humans. Thus, the formerly large montane heathlands slowly degraded into small and isolated patches. In this study, we evaluate the influence of restoration measures on leafhopper (Auchenorrhyncha) assemblages of montane heathland ecosystems in Central Europe. Our analyses comprised three different site types that were adjacent to each other: (1) montane heathlands, (2) restoration sites, and (3) control sites. Leafhoppers showed a clear response to montane heathland restoration. Thus, after 4–5 years since implementation of restoration measurements restoration sites were characterized by the highest species richness. However, detailed analyses of leafhopper diversity, species composition, and environmental parameters on the three site types revealed that restoration sites were rather similar to control sites and significantly differing from montane heathlands. We conclude that leafhoppers are excellent bioindicators for restoration measurements because they reflected environmental differences between the three site types. Restoration measurements might only be a useful instrument to promote typical montane heathland leafhopper communities in the long run. Colonization by leafhoppers is, however, dependent on many different factors such as leafhopper mobility, vegetation structure, microclimate, and the establishment of ericaceous dwarf shrubs. Practitioners should establish a management regime (grazing and sod-cutting) that creates a mosaic of different habitat structures and increases typical heathland vegetation, thus, favoring the colonization of typical heathland leafhoppers.},

Therefore, successful restoration efforts should select native species with traits similar to likely invaders and include a diversity of functional traits.

Nearly 10 000 intact seeds from 58 species were recovered from the droppings of 18 bird and reptile dispersers. The most dispersed invaders were Lantana camara, Rubus niveus and Psidium guajava, the latter two likely benefiting from an asynchronous fruit production with most native plants, which facilitate their consumption and spread. Lava lizards dispersed the seeds of 27 species, being the most important dispersers, followed by small ground finch, two mockingbirds, the giant tortoise and two insectivorous birds. Most animals dispersed alien seeds, but these formed a relatively small proportion of the interactions. Nevertheless, the integration of aliens was higher in the island that has been invaded for longest, suggesting a time-lag between alien plant introductions and their impacts on seed dispersal networks. Alien plants become more specialized with advancing invasion, favouring more simplified plant and disperser communities. However, only habitat type significantly affected the overall network structure. Alien plants were dispersed via two pathways: dry-fruited plants were preferentially dispersed by finches, while fleshy fruited species were mostly dispersed by other birds and reptiles.},

	abstract = {1. The loss of a species from an ecological community can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. Here we investigate how the complexity (connectance) of model communities affects their response to species loss. Using dynamic analysis based on a global criterion of persistence (permanence) and topological analysis we investigate the extent of secondary extinctions following the loss of different kinds of species. 2. We show that complex communities are, on average, more resistant to species loss than simple communities: the number of secondary extinctions decreases with increasing connectance. However, complex communities are more vulnerable to loss of top predators than simple communities. 3. The loss of highly connected species (species with many links to other species) and species at low trophic levels triggers, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions. The effect of the connectivity of a species is strongest in webs with low connectance. 4. Most secondary extinctions are due to direct bottom-up effects: consumers go extinct when their resources are lost. Secondary extinctions due to trophic cascades and disruption of predator-mediated coexistence also occur. Secondary extinctions due to disruption of predator-mediated coexistence are more common in complex communities than in simple communities, while bottom-up and top-down extinction cascades are more common in simple communities. 5. Topological analysis of the response of communities to species loss always predicts a lower number of secondary extinctions than dynamic analysis, especially in food webs with high connectance.},

This fact is widely recognized and the term "keystone species" has been introduced for the most important members of communities. In a recent paper, Power et al. called for methods suitable for a priori identification of keystone species, which is an urgent problem in conservation biology. Another problem is the scarcity of their quantitative description. In this paper, we propose an index for characterizing keystone species reflecting their role in food web flow networks. We present some calculations for characterizing the role of keystones in weighted webs and discuss some problems of food web dynamics. Our keystone index refers well to keystones only if trophic interactions are of prime importance in a community. We further analyse the relationship between keystone species and the reliability of network flow. Keystones make network flow less reliable. Finally, we discuss some problems of stability and reliability in ecological systems.},

Although there are many records of non-syrphid Diptera visiting flowers, they are generally not regarded as important pollinators. We use data from 30 pollen-transport networks and 71 pollinator-visitation networks to compare the importance of various flower-visiting taxa as pollen-vectors. We specifically compare non-syrphid Diptera and Syrphidae to determine whether neglect of the former in the literature is justified. We found no significant difference in pollen-loads between the syrphid and non-syrphid Diptera. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the level of specialization between the two groups in the pollen-transport networks, though the Syrphidae had significantly greater visitation evenness. Flower visitation data from 33 farms showed that non-syrphid Diptera made up the majority of the flower-visiting Diptera in the agricultural studies (on average 82\% abundance and 73\% species richness), and we estimate that non-syrphid Diptera carry 84\% of total pollen carried by farmland Diptera. As important pollinators, such as bees, have suffered serious declines, it would be prudent to improve our understanding of the role of non-syrphid Diptera as pollinators.},

	abstract = {Nontarget species such as pollinators may be of great importance to the restoration process and the long-term functioning of restored habitats, but little is known about how such groups respond to habitat restoration. I surveyed bee communities at five equal-aged restored sites, paired with five reference sites (riparian remnants) along the Sacramento River, California, United States. Flower availability and bee visitation patterns were also measured to examine the restoration of pollination function. Restoration of structural vegetation allowed diverse and abundant native bee communities to establish at the restoration sites; however, the composition of these important pollinator communities was distinct from that in the remnant riparian sites. Differences did not arise primarily from differences in the composition of the flowering-plant community; rather there must be other physical characteristics of the restored sites or differences in nesting site availability that led to the different pollinator communities. Because sites were spatially paired, the differences are unlikely to be driven by landscape context. Bee life-history and other biological traits may partially explain the differences between bee communities at restored and remnant sites. Patterns of visitation to native plant species suggest that pollination function is restored along with pollinator abundance and richness; however, function may be less robust in restored habitats. An examination of interaction networks between bees and plant species found at both restored and remnant riparian sites showed less redundancy of pollinators visiting some plants at restored habitats.},

	abstract = {The effects of herbivores and diversity on plant communities have been studied separately but rarely in combination. We conducted two concurrent experiments over 3 years to examine how tree seedling diversity, density and herbivory affected forest regeneration. One experiment factorially manipulated plant diversity (one versus 15 species) and the presence/absence of deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found that mixtures outperformed monocultures only in the presence of deer. Selective browsing on competitive dominants and associational protection from less palatable species appear responsible for this herbivore-driven diversity effect. The other experiment manipulated monospecific plant density and found little evidence for negative density dependence. Combined, these experiments suggest that the higher performance in mixture was owing to the acquisition of positive interspecific interactions rather than the loss of negative intraspecific interactions. Overall, we emphasize that realistic predictions about the consequences of changing biodiversity will require a deeper understanding of the interaction between plant diversity and higher trophic levels. If we had manipulated only plant diversity, we would have missed an important positive interaction across trophic levels: diverse seedling communities better resist herbivores, and herbivores help to maintain seedling diversity.},

	note = {The effects of herbivores and diversity on plant communities have been studied separately but rarely in combination. We conducted two concurrent experiments over 3 years to examine how tree seedling diversity, density and herbivory affected forest regeneration. One experiment factorially manipulated plant diversity (one versus 15 species) and the presence/absence of deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). We found that mixtures outperformed monocultures only in the presence of deer. Selective browsing on competitive dominants and associational protection from less palatable species appear responsible for this herbivore-driven diversity effect. The other experiment manipulated monospecific plant density and found little evidence for negative density dependence. Combined, these experiments suggest that the higher performance in mixture was owing to the acquisition of positive interspecific interactions rather than the loss of negative intraspecific interactions. Overall, we emphasize that realistic predictions about the consequences of changing biodiversity will require a deeper understanding of the interaction between plant diversity and higher trophic levels. If we had manipulated only plant diversity, we would have missed an important positive interaction across trophic levels: diverse seedling communities better resist herbivores, and herbivores help to maintain seedling diversity.},

	abstract = {Agri-environment schemes are an increasingly important tool for the maintenance and restoration of farmland biodiversity in Europe but their ecological effects are poorly known. Scheme design is partly based on non-ecological considerations and poses important restrictions on evaluation studies. We describe a robust approach to evaluate agri-environment schemes and use it to evaluate the biodiversity effects of agri-environment schemes in five European countries. We compared species density of vascular plants, birds, bees, grasshoppers and crickets, and spiders on 202 paired fields, one with an agri-environment scheme, the other conventionally managed. In all countries, agri-environment schemes had marginal to moderately positive effects on biodiversity. However, uncommon species benefited in only two of five countries and species listed in Red Data Books rarely benefited from agri-environment schemes. Scheme objectives may need to differentiate between biodiversity of common species that can be enhanced with relatively simple modifications in farming practices and diversity or abundance of endangered species which require more elaborate conservation measures.},

	abstract = {External threats from agricultural intensification, fire encroachment, species invasion and illegal harvesting present major conservation challenges in isolated tropical forest remnants. These processes can greatly exacerbate the magnitude of edge effects as the degree of patch to matrix contrast increases. Theory suggests that mitigation of these effects should be possible through conservation strategies that remove external threats and restore adjacent matrix structure, but this has not been tested experimentally. In the rapidly-dwindling Afromontane rainforests of Nigeria, where nature reserves have the least protection of all African conservation areas, we created an experimental matrix restoration treatment in which we excluded livestock by fencing, maintained a fire-exclusion break, and passively revegetated a 200 m buffer zone in the surrounding matrix at replicated edges. After three years, dung beetle communities in remnant forests showed a 53\% increase in abundance at sites adjacent to the restored matrix. Over 90\% of the common dung beetle species differed in the magnitude of their edge responses between forest-to-restored versus forest-to-degraded matrix sites. Moreover, a significant difference in species richness across the forest-to-degraded matrix edge became non-significant following matrix restoration, and there was also a significant decrease in community dissimilarity across the edge gradient in these regenerating sites. Just three years after excluding threatening processes from comparatively small areas of matrix habitat, we found that these efforts not only reduced edge effects, but also (1) enhanced dung beetle populations in the adjacent reserve, (2) led to an increase in dung beetle capture rates in the regenerating matrix, and (3) facilitated re-establishment of species that were absent due to matrix degradation. Therefore, regenerating buffers can substantially increase effective reserve size and restore invertebrate communities in landscape mosaics where remnant habitats are embedded within anthropogenic landscapes.},

	abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

Using a large, moderately well-known web, we simulated ecologists' efforts to detect member species and links between them at a variety of sampling intensities, and then we analyzed the effects of sampling intensity on a large number of properties of the resulting webs. Four striking points emerged. First, the properties of this single web vary markedly with the intensity of sampling: incompleteness of data can strongly bias estimates of food-web properties. Second, the original values are reached only after a high level of sampling, much higher than is typical for many studies. Third, the properties of most webs in the ECOWeB database lie at the poorly sampled end of the ranges. Fourth, the detection of trophic links systematically lags behind the detection and inclusion of species, which may render the accurate measurement of many web properties inherently problematic. These results suggest that both the incompleteness of the existing data and our focus on properties that are sensitive to that incompleteness may be giving us a misleading picture of the trophic structure of ecological communities.},

	abstract = {1. The study of plant–pollinator interactions in a network context is receiving increasing attention. This approach has helped to identify several emerging network patterns such as nestedness and modularity. However, most studies are based only on qualitative information, and some ecosystems, such as deserts and tropical forests, are underrepresented in these data sets. 2. We present an exhaustive analysis of the structure of a 4-year plant–pollinator network from the Monte desert in Argentina using qualitative and quantitative tools. We describe the structure of this network and evaluate sampling completeness using asymptotic species richness estimators. Our goal is to assess the extent to which the realized sampling effort allows for an accurate description of species interactions and to estimate the minimum number of additional censuses required to detect 90\% of the interactions. We evaluated completeness of detection of the community-wide pollinator fauna, of the pollinator fauna associated with each plant species and of the plant–pollinator interactions. We also evaluated whether sampling completeness was influenced by plant characteristics, such as flower abundance, flower life span, number of interspecific links (degree) and selectiveness in the identity of their flower visitors, as well as sampling effort. 3. We found that this desert plant–pollinator network has a nested structure and that it exhibits modularity and high network-level generalization. 4. In spite of our high sampling effort, and although we sampled 80\% of the pollinator fauna, we recorded only 55\% of the interactions. Furthermore, although a 64\% increase in sampling effort would suffice to detect 90\% of the pollinator species, a fivefold increase in sampling effort would be necessary to detect 90\% of the interactions. 5. Detection of interactions was incomplete for most plant species, particularly specialists with a long flowering season and high flower abundance, or generalists with short flowering span and scant flowers. Our results suggest that sampling of a network with the same effort for all plant species is inadequate to sample interactions. 6. Sampling the diversity of interactions is labour intensive, and most plant–pollinator networks published to date are likely to be undersampled. Our analysis allowed estimating the completeness of our sampling, the additional effort needed to detect most interactions and the plant traits that influence the detection of their interactions.},

	abstract = {Abstract: It is widely believed that the diversity of plants influences the diversity of animals, and this should be particularly true of herbivores. We examine this supposition at a moderate spatial extent by comparing the richness patterns of the 217 butterfly species resident in California to those of plants, including all 5,902 vascular plant species and the 552 species known to be fed on by caterpillars. We also examine the relationships between plant/butterfly richness and 20 environmental variables. We found that although plant and butterfly diversities are positively correlated, multiple regression, path models, and spatial analysis indicate that once primary productivity (estimated by a water‐energy variable, actual evapotranspiration) and topographical variability are incorporated into models, neither measure of plant richness has any relationship with butterfly richness. To examine whether butterflies with the most specialized diets follow the pattern found across all butterflies, we repeated the analyses for 37 species of strict monophages and their food plants and found that plant and butterfly richness were similarly weakly associated after incorporating the environmental variables. We conclude that plant diversity does not directly influence butterfly diversity but that both are probably responding to similar environmental factors.},

Temperate and tropical tree species of comparable phylogenetic distribution supported similar numbers of folivorous insect species, 29.0 ± 2.2 and 23.5 ± 1.8 per 100 square meters of foliage, respectively. Host specificity did not differ significantly between community samples, indicating that food resources are not more finely partitioned among folivorous insects in tropical than in temperate forests.

	abstract = {A primary reason for restoring plant communities is to increase biodiversity to previous levels. It is expected that restoring land with greater plant diversity will increase biodiversity at higher trophic levels, but high diversity seed mixes are expensive. In this study, we used one insect family, leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) to assess the difference in leafhopper communities that result from establishing high compared with low plant richness restorations. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) the added effort of a high richness restoration leads to measurable increases in both diversity and richness of leafhoppers; and (2) that leafhopper community composition is more similar to remnant prairies in high richness than in low plant richness restorations. We found that higher plant richness led to 3- to 7-fold increases in leafhopper and prairie-dependent leafhopper diversity and richness in restorations. Leafhopper communities in high richness restorations were not more similar to remnant prairies, rather they were distinct among high and low richness restorations and prairie interior. Leafhopper richness and diversity correlated with plant richness, and leafhopper community composition differed among plant community assemblages, but not with the occurrence of single plant species. For our sites, species-rich restorations provided better quality habitat for leafhoppers that was comparable to remnant prairie. Our results suggest that restorations with high plant species richness better support animal food webs.},

	abstract = {* 1Attempts to restore damaged ecosystems usually emphasize structural aspects of biodiversity, such as species richness and abundance. An alternative is to emphasize functional aspects, such as patterns of interaction between species. Pollination is a ubiquitous interaction between plants and animals. Patterns in plant–pollinator interactions can be analysed with a food web or complex-systems approach and comparing pollination webs between restored and reference sites can be used to test whether ecological restoration has taken place.
* 2Using an ecological network approach, we compared plant–pollinator interactions on four pairs of restored and ancient heathlands 11 and 14 years following initiation of restoration management. We used the network data to test whether visitation by pollinators had been restored and we calculated pollinator importance indices for each insect species on the eight sites. Finally, we compared the robustness of the restored and ancient networks to species loss.
* 3Plant and pollinator communities were established successfully on the restored sites. There was little evidence of movement of pollinators from ancient sites onto adjacent restored sites, although paired sites correlated in pollinator species richness in both years. There was little insect species overlap within each heathland between 2001 and 2004.
* 4A few widespread insect species dominated the communities and were the main pollinators. The most important pollinators were typically honeybees (Apis mellifera), species of bumblebee (Bombus spp.) and one hoverfly species (Episyrphus balteatus). The interaction networks were significantly less complex on restored heathlands, in terms of connectance values, although in 2004 the low values might reflect the negative relationship between connectance and species richness. Finally, there was a trend of restored networks being more susceptible to perturbation than ancient networks, although this needs to be interpreted with caution.
* 5Synthesis and applications. Ecological networks provide a powerful tool for assessing the outcome of restoration programmes. Our results indicate that heathland restoration does not have to occur immediately adjacent to ancient heathland for functional pollinator communities to be established. Moreover, in terms of restoring pollinator interactions, heathland managers need only be concerned with the most common insect species. Our focus on pollination demonstrates how a key ecological service can serve as a yardstick for judging restoration success.},

Much remains unknown about the role of these various drivers in determining food chain length, and particularly about the mechanisms by which they may operate in terrestrial ecosystems, which have quite different ecological constraints than aquatic environments, where most food chain length studies have been thus far conducted. In this study, we tested the relative importance of ecosystem size and productivity in influencing food chain length in a terrestrial setting. We determined that (1) there is no effect of ecosystem size or productive space on food chain length; (2) rather, food chain length increases strongly and linearly with productivity; and (3) the observed changes in food chain length are likely achieved through a combination of changes in predator size, predator behavior, and consumer diversity along gradients in productivity. These results lend new insight into the mechanisms by which productivity can drive changes in food chain length, point to potential for systematic differences in the drivers of food web structure between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and challenge us to consider how ecological context may control the drivers that shape food chain length.},

	abstract = {* 1Community structure involving large taxonomical groups is frequently used to assess changes in ecosystems along environmental gradients or in response to disturbance. For terrestrial arthropods, abundance is generally used as the response variable in community data analyses; biomass, however, is generally a better indicator of the functionality of a species within a community, as it is strongly correlated with metabolism.
* 2In this study, we considered whether biomass should be used more often in community analyses with terrestrial arthropod biodiversity data, particularly when asking questions involving strong functional components. We selected 10 previously published and five unpublished Coleoptera abundance data sets, and produced biomass species-by-sample matrices using body length to body mass conversion equations, and then compared the results obtained using commonly used ecological analyses.
* 3Correlations between species abundance and biomass varied from strong to poor, depending on the taxa considered and on the sampling method used. We show that abundance and biomass can produce different results in community data analysis and lead to alternative interpretations for data sets with poor abundance to biomass correlations.
* 4Synthesis and applications. When dealing with databases showing poor abundance to biomass relationships, the question of the relevance of using biomass instead of abundance emerges, and the choice of the response variable to be used in analyses should be considered carefully. At the very least, when studying terrestrial arthropod biodiversity, one should consider the use of biomass with simple conversion equations that do not require obtaining the mass of individual specimens. This approach may lead to different interpretations. For research questions in which trophic interactions may play an important role, biomass may provide a broader and more accurate picture of the processes driving changes in community structure.},

Consistent with previous suggestions,, our results show that weak to intermediate strength links are important in promoting community persistence and stability. Weak links act to dampen oscillations between consumers and resources. This tends to maintain population densities further away from zero, decreasing the statistical chance that a population will become extinct (lower population densities are more prone to such chances). Data on interaction strengths in natural food webs indicate that food-web interaction strengths are indeed characterized by many weak interactions and a few strong interactions.},

	abstract = {* Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions.


* We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning.


* The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities.


* We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups.


* Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.},

	abstract = {Human activities drive biotic homogenization (loss of regional diversity) of many taxa. However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid–host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence–absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid–host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels.},

Against pluralists, who hold that biodiversity consists of distinct but correlated properties of natural systems, I argue that the supposed correlations between these properties are not tight enough to warrant treating and measuring them as a bundle. I additionally argue that deflationary theories of biodiversity don’t go far enough, since a large proportion of what we value in the environment falls outside bounds of what could reasonably be called “diversity”. I suggest that in current scientific practice biodiversity is generally an unnecessary placeholder for biological value of all sorts, and that we are better off eliminating it from conservation biology, or at least drastically reducing its role.},

This Artificial Intelligence approach provides the ability to test the performance of any index for prioritizing species management in a network. While no single network theory index provides an appropriate guide to management for all food webs, a modified version of the Google PageRank algorithm reliably minimizes the chance and severity of negative outcomes. Our analysis shows that by prioritizing ecosystem management based on the network-wide impact of species protection rather than species loss, we can substantially improve conservation outcomes.},

Several hypotheses argue that foraging in groups can be beneficial in terms of MFIR but an overall assessment of the evidence available thus far was lacking. I examined this relationship in birds using studies that provided a measure of MFIR in groups of different sizes and evaluated the effect of study design and food type. In addition, I noted some of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for changes in MFIR with group size and quantified the impact of the addition of individual foragers. The most common pattern of change in MFIR with group size was a monotonic increase. The different patterns of change in MFIR with group size occurred with similar frequencies in experimental and observational studies despite the fact that observational studies often lacked control for confounding factors. Increases in MFIR were more likely to be associated with seeds as a food type than with fish or invertebrates, and were least likely with carcasses. This finding was related to the ease with which individuals can use aggression to increase their share of resources that are more concentrated in space. Adjustments in vigilance levels and aggression, as well as more subtle changes in speed of search and handling time, were correlated with changes in MFIR with group size. Finally, the addition of three to four individuals appeared to be needed to double the MFIR of a solitary bird. The results suggest that foraging in avian groups is often associated with increased MFIRs and that several ecological factors, including food dispersion, influence the pattern of change with group size.},

There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {Extensive land-use change in the tropics has produced a mosaic of successional forests within an agricultural and cattle-pasture matrix. Post-disturbance biodiversity assessments have found that regeneration speed depends upon propagule availability and the intensity and duration of disturbance. However, reestablishment of species interactions is still poorly understood and this limits our understanding of the anthropogenic impacts upon ecosystem resilience. This is the first investigation that evaluates plant-herbivore interaction networks during secondary succession. In particular we investigated succession in a Mexican tropical dry forest using data of caterpillar associations with plants during 2007–2010. Plant-herbivore networks showed high resilience. We found no differences in most network descriptors between secondary and mature forest and only recently abandoned fields were found to be different. No significant nestedness or modularity network structure was found. Plant-herbivore network properties appear to quickly reestablish after perturbation, despite differences in species richness and composition. This study provides some valuable guidelines for the implement of restoration efforts that can enhance ecological processes such as the interaction between plants and their herbivores.},

	abstract = {BackgroundSome neotropical, fleshy-fruited plants have fruits structurally similar to paleotropical fruits dispersed by megafauna (mammals {\textgreater}103 kg), yet these dispersers were extinct in South America 10–15 Kyr BP. Anachronic dispersal systems are best explained by interactions with extinct animals and show impaired dispersal resulting in altered seed dispersal dynamics.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe introduce an operational definition of megafaunal fruits and perform a comparative analysis of 103 Neotropical fruit species fitting this dispersal mode. We define two megafaunal fruit types based on previous analyses of elephant fruits: fruits 4–10 cm in diameter with up to five large seeds, and fruits {\textgreater}10 cm diameter with numerous small seeds. Megafaunal fruits are well represented in unrelated families such as Sapotaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Apocynaceae, Malvaceae, Caryocaraceae, and Arecaceae and combine an overbuilt design (large fruit mass and size) with either a single or few ({\textless}3 seeds) extremely large seeds or many small seeds (usually {\textgreater}100 seeds). Within-family and within-genus contrasts between megafaunal and non-megafaunal groups of species indicate a marked difference in fruit diameter and fruit mass but less so for individual seed mass, with a significant trend for megafaunal fruits to have larger seeds and seediness.Conclusions/SignificanceMegafaunal fruits allow plants to circumvent the trade-off between seed size and dispersal by relying on frugivores able to disperse enormous seed loads over long-distances. Present-day seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents, introduced livestock, runoff, flooding, gravity, and human-mediated dispersal allowed survival of megafauna-dependent fruit species after extinction of the major seed dispersers. Megafauna extinction had several potential consequences, such as a scale shift reducing the seed dispersal distances, increasingly clumped spatial patterns, reduced geographic ranges and limited genetic variation and increased among-population structuring. These effects could be extended to other plant species dispersed by large vertebrates in present-day, defaunated communities.},

We summarise the progression of food-web ecology and the challenges in using the food-web approach. We identify five areas of research where these advances can continue, and be applied to global challenges.

A wet to dry gradient was distinguished, as were evergreen plants, and early successional plant families with weeds and annuals. Taxonomically, plant families of the same order were closer together if they were predominantly of the same life form. Fagales and several orders of monocotyledons formed particularly clear groups. The three ‘nearest neighbours’ of each plant family based on the dissimilarities measures were listed. These provide some interesting, but conjectural, data on evolutionary aspects of plant families. This was illustrated briefly by the Cornaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The underlying progressive evolution of plants from woody species and wetter areas to herbs and annual plants of dry and cold places may be reflected by insect and mite food plant family associations.},

Although it is correlative, advocates of the comparative method hope that it will reveal general mechanisms in conservation, provide shortcuts for prioritizing conservation research, and enable us to predict which species will experience (or create) problems in the future. Here, we ask whether these stated management goals are being achieved. We conclude that comparative methods are stimulating research into the ecological mechanisms underlying conservation, and are providing information for preemptive screening of problem species. But comparative analyses of extinction risk to date have tended to be too broad in scope to provide shortcuts to conserving particular endangered species. Correlates of vulnerability to conservation problems are often taxon, region and threat specific, so models must be narrowly focused to be of maximum practical use.},

	abstract = {The bud-galling sawfly, Euura mucronata, attacked longer shoot length classes on its host, Salix cinerea, more frequently than shorter shoots. Shoot length accounted for 76 to 93 percent of the variance in number of galls per 100 shoots in three habitats: forest, watermeadow, and lakeside. The reasons for this pattern were addressed with studies on shoot length in relation to: 1. Number of resources (buds) per shoot; 2. Success in establishment of larvae in galls; 3. Gall size and resources per gall; and 4. Survival of larvae after establishment as influenced by plant resistance and natural enemy attack. The most important factors proved to be success in establishment of larvae, with percent of variance accounted for ranging from 57 to 77 percent in three of four sites where relationships were significant, and survival after establishment of larvae, with variance accounted for ranging from 40 to 54 percent in the same three sites. The pattern of survival was dictated by plant resistance and not by natural enemies. These two additive factors resulted in a general relationship across all sites of increasing emergence of fully developed larvae per cohort as shoot length increased, accounting for 78 percent of the variance. These adaptive advantages to attacking longer shoots are sufficient to account for the pattern of increased probability of shoots being attacked as they increase in length.},

	abstract = {Species' functional roles in key ecosystem processes such as predation, pollination or seed dispersal are determined by the resource use of consumer species. An interaction between resource and consumer species usually requires trait matching (e.g. a congruence in the morphologies of interaction partners). Species' morphology should therefore determine species' functional roles in ecological processes mediated by mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. We tested this assumption for Neotropical plant–bird mutualisms. We used a new analytical framework that assesses a species's functional role based on the analysis of the traits of its interaction partners in a multidimensional trait space. We employed this framework to test (i) whether there is correspondence between the morphology of bird species and their functional roles and (ii) whether morphologically specialized birds fulfil specialized functional roles. We found that morphological differences between bird species reflected their functional differences: (i) bird species with different morphologies foraged on distinct sets of plant species and (ii) morphologically distinct bird species fulfilled specialized functional roles. These findings encourage further assessments of species' functional roles through the analysis of their interaction partners, and the proposed analytical framework facilitates a wide range of novel analyses for network and community ecology.},

	abstract = {Social evolution has influenced every aspect of contemporary honey bee biology, but the details are difficult to reconstruct. The reproductive ground plan hypothesis of social evolution proposes that central regulators of the gonotropic cycle of solitary insects have been co-opted to coordinate social complexity in honey bees, such as the division of labor among workers. The predicted trait associations between reproductive physiology and social behavior have been identified in the context of the pollen hoarding syndrome, a larger suite of interrelated traits. The genetic architecture of this syndrome is characterized by a partially overlapping genetic architecture with several consistent, pleiotropic quantitative trait loci (QTL). Despite these central QTL and an integrated hormonal regulation, separate aspects of the pollen hoarding syndrome may evolve independently due to peripheral QTL and additionally segregating genetic variance. The characterization of the pollen hoarding syndrome has also demonstrated that this syndrome involves many non-behavioral traits, which may be the case for numerous “behavioral” syndromes. Furthermore, the genetic architecture of the pollen hoarding syndrome has implications for breeding programs for improving honey health and other desirable traits: if these traits are comparable to the pollen hoarding syndrome, consistent pleiotropic QTL will enable marker-assisted selection, while sufficient additional genetic variation may permit the dissociation of trade-offs for efficient multiple trait selection.},

	abstract = {Intensive farming has contributed to the serious declines in abundance and geographic range suffered by several bumblebee species in Europe and North America. Recent UK agri-environmental policy aims to conserve and restore bumblebee populations by providing foraging habitats on arable field margins. We examined the effectiveness of strategies to achieve this, including sowing seed mixtures of (1) tussocky grass species, (2) wildflowers and (3) pollen- and nectar-rich plants. These were compared to conventionally managed cereal crops. Sampling was undertaken in 32 10 × 10 km squares throughout England, each containing a sample of the different field margin types. Bumblebee abundance in July and August was significantly higher on pollen and nectar margins (86 ± 14 bees per 100 m) compared with wildflower margins (43 ± 14), mature grass margins (6 ± 14) and recently sown grass margins (8 ± 4). Bees were virtually absent from the cereal crop (0.2 ± 0.1). Bumblebee species richness was significantly higher on margins sown with either wildflowers or the pollen and nectar mix. There was evidence that richness of the bumblebee assemblage at the 10 × 10 km square scale was positively correlated with land use heterogeneity, the proportion of grassland, and the abundance and richness of dicotyledon flowers. The abundance of long-tongued bees per margin was explained by the number of pollen and nectar agreements per 10 × 10 km square, together with flower abundance. Future research is required to determine the quantity and location of foraging habitat required to sustain bumblebee populations at the landscape scale.},

Few studies, however, have examined arthropods from trees in restoration plantings, and little is known about how different tree plantings might lead to different biodiversity outcomes. The aim of our study was to determine if a focal tree species hosted a different arthropod fauna depending on its context. We examined arthropod assemblages from the foliage of Eucalyptus microcarpa (Grey Box) trees present in two kinds of plantings: (i) simple plantings with only Eucalyptus trees, and (ii) mixed plantings with both Eucalyptus and Acacia trees. We examined the composition of the assemblages, and looked for associations between ant and psyllid (Hemiptera) diversity across each kind of planting. We found more species of psyllids, beetles and ants in E. microcarpa trees when they were grown in simple plantings compared with the mixed species plantings. We also found that psyllid richness and abundance was positively correlated with ant richness and abundance across all plantings. Our study shows that a more diverse context (i.e. a mixed planting) is not necessarily associated with a more diverse fauna within a focal tree species, and that simple Eucalyptus-only plantings may encourage higher numbers of insect herbivores. The apparent association between psyllids and ants suggests a complex interaction that may drive patterns in tree arthropod assemblages.},

Methods:  Two data sets comprised of 75 timed, one-hour censuses of vascular plants carried out by five observers on 24 400-m2 forest quadrats were analysed using mixed-effect models. Results:  The level of exhaustiveness increased in a semi-logarithmic way with sampling time and decreased with quadrat species richness. After one hour, 20 to 30\% of the species remained undetected by single observers. This proportion varied among observers and the discrepancy increased with increasing sampling time. Fixing the sampling time may make richness estimates vary less between observers but the time limit should be at least 30 min to reduce the bias in exhaustiveness between rich and poor quadrats. Conclusions We advocate the use of sampling methods based on spatially or temporally-replicated censuses and statistical analyses that correct for the lack of census exhaustiveness in vegetation studies.},

	abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category–subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods – both sample-based and individual-based – allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Coastal sage scrub in California and northern Baja California has been severely affected by urban expansion and is, in places, badly in need of restoration. We measured arthropod abundance and diversity on one of its primary components, the native shrub Artemisia californica ( Asteraceae; California sage ), to evaluate whether arthropod communities had become reestablished after a restoration attempt. Arthropods were collected from shrubs on planted and undisturbed sites 6 years after a restoration attempt. Fifty-seven families and 146 adult morphospecies were found. Family and species richness were greater on planted shrubs, but arthropod diversity, once differences in species' abundances were corrected for, was greater on naturally established plants. Common arthropods occurred at similar densities regardless of planting history. The proportion of single occurrences of a species, in contrast, was significantly greater on naturally established shrubs. Planted shrubs supported more predators relative to herbivores than did naturally established shrubs. Planted shrubs were still distinguishable from naturally established ones in that they were both more isolated from neighboring shrubs and surrounded by more invasive weeds. We suggest that small-scale restoration attempts can be successful at restoring basic elements of surrounding biodiversity. They do create a different community, however, both taxonomically and functionally, and are at least initially less able to support rare species.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity sampling is labor intensive, and a substantial fraction of a biota is often represented by species of very low abundance, which typically remain undetected by biodiversity surveys. Statistical methods are widely used to estimate the asymptotic number of species present, including species not yet detected. Additional sampling is required to detect and identify these species, but richness estimators do not indicate how much sampling effort (additional individuals or samples) would be necessary to reach the asymptote of the species accumulation curve. Here we develop the first statistically rigorous nonparametric method for estimating the minimum number of additional individuals, samples, or sampling area required to detect any arbitrary proportion (including 100\%) of the estimated asymptotic species richness. The method uses the Chao1 and Chao2 nonparametric estimators of asymptotic richness, which are based on the frequencies of rare species in the original sampling data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we randomly subsampled individuals or quadrats from two large biodiversity inventories (light trap captures of Lepidoptera in Great Britain and censuses of woody plants on Barro Colorado Island [BCI], Panama). The simulation results suggest that the method performs well but is slightly conservative for small sample sizes. Analyses of the BCI results suggest that the method is robust to nonindependence arising from small-scale spatial aggregation of species occurrences. When the method was applied to seven published biodiversity data sets, the additional sampling effort necessary to capture all the estimated species ranged from 1.05 to 10.67 times the original sample (median ≈ 2.23). Substantially less effort is needed to detect 90\% of the species (0.33–1.10 times the original effort; median ≈ 0.80). An Excel spreadsheet tool is provided for calculating necessary sampling effort for either abundance data or replicated incidence data.},

Yet, the relationship between plant and animal diversity is explained by a variety of competing hypotheses, with mixed empirical results for each hypothesis. We sampled arthropods for over a decade in an experiment that manipulated the number of grassland plant species. We found that herbivore and predator species richness were strongly, positively related to plant species richness, and that these relationships were caused by different mechanisms at herbivore and predator trophic levels. Even more dramatic was the threefold increase, from low- to high-plant species richness, in abundances of predatory and parasitoid arthropods relative to their herbivorous prey. Our results demonstrate that, over the long term, the loss of plant species propagates through food webs, greatly decreasing arthropod species richness, shifting a predator-dominated trophic structure to being herbivore dominated, and likely impacting ecosystem functioning and services.},

	abstract = {Long-term and persistent human disturbances have simultaneously altered the stability and diversity of ecological systems, with disturbances directly reducing functional attributes such as invasion resistance, while eliminating the buffering effects of high species diversity. Theory predicts that this combination of environmental change and diversity loss increases the risk of abrupt and potentially irreversible ecosystem collapse, but long-term empirical evidence from natural systems is lacking. Here we demonstrate this relationship in a degraded but species-rich pyrogenic grassland in which the combined effects of fire suppression, invasion and trophic collapse have created a species-poor grassland that is highly productive, resilient to yearly climatic fluctuations, and resistant to invasion, but vulnerable to rapid collapse after the re-introduction of fire. We initially show how human disturbance has created a negative relationship between diversity and function, contrary to theoretical predictions. Fire prevention since the mid-nineteenth century is associated with the loss of plant species but it has stabilized high-yield annual production and invasion resistance, comparable to a managed high-yield low-diversity agricultural system. In managing for fire suppression, however, a hidden vulnerability to sudden environmental change emerges that is explained by the elimination of the buffering effects of high species diversity. With the re-introduction of fire, grasslands only persist in areas with remnant concentrations of native species, in which a range of rare and mostly functionally redundant plants proliferate after burning and prevent extensive invasion including a rapid conversion towards woodland. This research shows how biodiversity can be crucial for ecosystem stability despite appearing functionally insignificant beforehand, a relationship probably applicable to many ecosystems given the globally prevalent combination of intensive long-term land management and species loss.},

	abstract = {As first noted by Aristotle in honeybee workers, many insect pollinators show a preference to visit flowers of just one species during a foraging trip. This “flower constancy” probably benefits plants, because pollen is more likely to be deposited on conspecific stigmas. But it is less clear why insects should ignore rewarding alternative flowers. Many researchers have argued that flower constancy is caused by constraints imposed by insect nervous systems rather than because flower constancy is itself an efficient foraging method. We argue that this view is unsatisfactory because it both fails to explain why foragers flexibly adjust the degree of flower constancy and does not explain why foragers of closely related species show different degrees of constancy. While limitations of the nervous system exist and are likely to influence flower constancy to some degree, the observed behavioural flexibility suggests that flower constancy is a successful foraging strategy given the insect’s own information about different foraging options.},

For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

There is wide concern, however, that the global diversity of arthropods may be declining even more rapidly than the diversity of vertebrates and plants. For adequate conservation planning, ecologists need to understand the driving factors for arthropod communities and devise methods that provide reliable predictions when resources do not permit exhaustive ground surveys. Which factor most successfully predicts arthropod community structure is still a matter of debate, however. The purpose of this study was to identify the factor best predicting arthropod assemblage composition. We investigated the species composition of seven functionally different arthropod groups (epigeic spiders, grasshoppers, ground beetles, weevils, hoppers, hoverflies, and bees) at 47 sites in The Netherlands comprising a range of seminatural grassland types and one heathland type. We then compared the actual arthropod composition with predictions based on plant species composition, vegetation structure, environmental data, flower richness, and landscape composition. For this we used the recently published method of predictive co-correspondence analysis, and a predictive variant of canonical correspondence analysis, depending on the type of predictor data. Our results demonstrate that local plant species composition is the most effective predictor of arthropod assemblage composition, for all investigated groups. In predicting arthropod assemblages, plant community composition consistently outperforms both vegetation structure and environmental conditions (even when the two are combined), and also performs better than the surrounding landscape. These results run against a common expectation of vegetation structure as the decisive factor. Such expectations, however, have always been biased by the fact that until recently no methods existed that could use an entire (plant) species composition in the explanatory role. Although more recent experimental diversity work has reawakened interest in the role of plant species, these studies still have not used (or have not been able to use) entire species compositions. They only consider diversity measures, both for plant and insect assemblages, which may obscure relationships. The present study demonstrates that the species compositions of insect and plant communities are clearly linked.},

	abstract = {The relationship between structure and stability in ecological networks and the effect of spatial dynamics on natural communities have both been major foci of ecological research for decades. Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species’ spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types.},

	abstract = {Despite the acknowledged importance of frugivores as seed dispersal agents we still lack a general understanding of the mechanisms by which these animals could shape plant populations and communities. We used a spatially explicit stochastic simulation to explore how frugivore movement decisions interact with landscape properties, thus affecting plant population dynamics through dispersal. The model simulated bird movement, foraging, seed deposition and plant recruitment. We assumed that plants lived only for one season and that recruitment was a function of local seed density. We also considered the effect of perches as non-food landscape features. Our simulation experiments consisted in varying the parameters governing bird foraging decisions in relation to 1) how fruit abundance biased their movement, and 2) how the willingness to visit a plant or perch decreased with distance to current location. Simulated plant population dynamics was strongly influenced by bird behavior. The scale of foraging decisions had a much stronger effect on plant dynamics than biases due to fruit abundance. Birds tended to concentrate their activities in the center of the landscape where plants became more abundant, increasing local competition. The presence of perches reduced this tendency resulting in larger population sizes. The importance of perches highlights the fact that behaviors other than foraging can have a strong impact on the patterns of seed deposition and hence on plant population dynamics. Several recent studies have combined animal movement data with seed retention time in order to predict seed dispersal kernels. These studies usually emphasize the ecological implications of the scale and shape of such kernels. However, our simulation results reveal that movement directionality and the fact that birds moved mostly among plants and perches can have a major impact on plant population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Because the quantity, quality, and heterogeneity of resources should affect the diversity of consumers, plant productivity, plant composition, and plant diversity may influence the diversity of trophic levels higher up the food chain ("bottom-up" control of diversity). Increasing plant productivity may increase herbivore diversity by: increasing the abundance of rare resources ("resource rarity hypothesis"), increasing herbivore abundance and local persistence ("consumer rarity hypothesis") or increasing intraspecific density dependence ("density dependence hypothesis"). Increasing plant diversity may increase the diversity of herbivores because herbivores specialized on these new plant species can persist locally. Increasing the diversity of herbivores could likewise increase the diversity of predators and parasites, although parasite and predator diversity may also respond directly to changes in vegetation. Here I use data from a well-replicated grassland experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to analyze the responses of arthropod diversity to independent manipulations of (1) plant productivity and (2) plant diversity and composition. Long-term nitrogen addition ("historical treatment") decreased plant diversity and favored C$_{\textrm{3}}$ grasses. Short-term nitrogen addition ("modern treatment") increased plant productivity without appreciably changing plant diversity or plant composition. Arthropods were sampled using both sweep nets and vacuum samplers. Total arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as species richness and abundance of every trophic group (detritivores, herbivores, parasites, and predators), were significantly greater in plots with higher levels of modern fertilization and greater plant productivity. Path analysis supported the consumer rarity hypothesis, because modern fertilization increased herbivore species richness only indirectly by increasing herbivore abundance. Surprisingly, higher levels of historical fertilization that lowered plant species richness (but did not change plant productivity) significantly increased total arthropod species richness, did not affect detritivore or herbivore species richness, and significantly increased parasite and predator species richness. Direct and indirect effects of historical fertilization on the species richness of trophic groups were separated satistically using block regression chain modeling. Herbivore species richness was decreased through the direct pathway, but this was offset through indirect effects so that there was no overall response to historical fertilization. In plots with low plant diversity, similar numbers of herbivore species supported a greater diversity of parasites and predators. These results suggest that the diversity and composition of plants control the diversity of consumers not only directly by determining available resources, but also indirectly by influencing the interactions between herbivores and their parasites and predators.},

Three informative patterns emerged: (1) both producer and herbivore biomass increase across a natural precipitation gradient; (2) the relative effect of large herbivores on plant biomass, inferred from exclosure studies, decreases with increasing precipitation; and (3) the effect of herbivores on changes in plant species composition increases with precipitation. Simple resource-controlled and consumer-controlled food chain models can explain different subsets of these patterns. However, models of heterogeneous food webs that incorporate differences among species within trophic levels, and compositional turnover within such trophic levels, are consistent with all of the reviewed patterns. We suggest that this compositional turnover of plant species, combined with the interactive controlling effects of consumers and resources, may help to explain why studies performed in different areas, and with different methodologies, often draw different conclusions about the patterns and structuring processes in grassland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Recent studies clarify where the most vulnerable species live, where and how humanity changes the planet, and how this drives extinctions. We assess key statistics about species, their distribution, and their status. Most are undescribed. Those we know best have large geographical ranges and are often common within them. Most known species have small ranges. The numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the likely background rate of extinction. Future rates depend on many factors and are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity.
Background A principal function of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is to “perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on biodiversity.” In December 2013, its second plenary session approved a program to begin a global assessment in 2015. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and five other biodiversity-related conventions have adopted IPBES as their science-policy interface, so these assessments will be important in evaluating progress toward the CBD’s Aichi Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020. As a contribution toward such assessment, we review the biodiversity of eukaryote species and their extinction rates, distributions, and protection. We document what we know, how it likely differs from what we do not, and how these differences affect biodiversity statistics. Interestingly, several targets explicitly mention “known species”—a strong, if implicit, statement of incomplete knowledge. We start by asking how many species are known and how many remain undescribed. We then consider by how much human actions inflate extinction rates. Much depends on where species are, because different biomes contain different numbers of species of different susceptibilities. Biomes also suffer different levels of damage and have unequal levels of protection. How extinction rates will change depends on how and where threats expand and whether greater protection counters them.
Different visualizations of species biodiversity. (A) The distributions of 9927 bird species. (B) The 4964 species with smaller than the median geographical range size. (C) The 1308 species assessed as threatened with a high risk of extinction by BirdLife International for the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. (D) The 1080 threatened species with less than the median range size. (D) provides a strong geographical focus on where local conservation actions can have the greatest global impact. Additional biodiversity maps are available at www.biodiversitymapping.org.
Advances Recent studies have clarified where the most vulnerable species live, where and how humanity changes the planet, and how this drives extinctions. These data are increasingly accessible, bringing greater transparency to science and governance. Taxonomic catalogs of plants, terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fish, and some marine taxa are sufficient to assess their status and the limitations of our knowledge. Most species are undescribed, however. The species we know best have large geographical ranges and are often common within them. Most known species have small ranges, however, and such species are typically newer discoveries. The numbers of known species with very small ranges are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. We expect unknown species to share these characteristics. Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the background rate of extinction. These are higher than previously estimated and likely still underestimated. Future rates will depend on many factors and are poised to increase. Finally, although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity.
Outlook Progress on assessing biodiversity will emerge from continued expansion of the many recently created online databases, combining them with new global data sources on changing land and ocean use and with increasingly crowdsourced data on species’ distributions. Examples of practical conservation that follow from using combined data in Colombia and Brazil can be found at www.savingspecies.org and www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3zjeJW2NVk.
Maintaining biodiversity: From here to eternity?
There has been substantial recent progress in determining the distributions and identity of vulnerable species, and in understanding how (and where) human activity is leading to extinctions. Pimm et al. review the current state of knowledge and ask what the future rates of species extinction will be, how well protected areas will slow extinction rates, and how the remaining gaps in knowledge might be filled.

	abstract = {A central issue in ecology is the definition and identification of keystone species, i.e. species that are relatively more important than others for maintaining community structure and ecosystem functioning. Network theory has been pointed out as a robust theoretical framework to enhance the operationality of the keystone species concept. We used the concept of centrality as a proxy for a species’ relative importance for the structure of seed dispersal networks composed of either frugivorous bats or birds and their food-plants. Centrality was expected to be determined mainly by dietary specialization, but also by body mass and geographic range size. Across 15 Neotropical datasets, only specialized frugivore species reached the highest values of centrality. Furthermore, the centrality of specialized frugivores varied widely within and among networks, whereas that of secondary and opportunistic frugivores was consistently low. A mixed-effects model showed that centrality was best explained by dietary specialization, but not by body mass or range size. Furthermore, the relationship between centrality and those three ecological correlates differed between bat– and bird–fruit networks. Our findings suggest that dietary specialization is key to understand what makes a frugivore species a keystone in seed dispersal networks, and that taxonomic identity also plays a significant role. Specialized frugivores may play a central role in network structuring and ecosystem functioning, which has important implications for conservation and restoration.},

The objectives of this study were to quantify recovery dynamics of these invertebrate groups across a chronosequence of restored prairies and elucidate whether changes in the abundance and biomass of ants and earthworms were related to key plant and ecosystem properties. We sampled ants and earthworms from cultivated fields, grasslands restored from 1 to 21 years, and native prairie. Ant abundance and biomass peaked between 5 and 8 years of restoration and abundance was 198 times greater than cultivated fields. Earthworm abundance increased linearly across the chronosequence and became representative of native prairie, but all earthworm populations were dominated by European species. Ant abundance and biomass were positively correlated with plant diversity and plant richness, whereas earthworm abundance biomass was only related to surface litter. These results demonstrate that earthworm abundance increases with time since cessation of cultivation and concomitant with prairie establishment, whereas the abundance and biomass of ants are more related to the structure of restored plant communities than time. The dominance of exotic earthworms in these restorations, coupled with their capacity to alter soil properties and processes may represent novel conditions for grassland development.},

*  Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss.


*  We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points.


*  Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the ‘health’ of ecosystems depends.},

However, current understanding of the ecological processes underlying this recovery is often incomplete and poorly integrated across different ecosystems. Here, we highlight recent conceptual findings in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning, food-web theory, and metacommunity theory that are relevant to restoration.

	abstract = {1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

Among the procedures used to describe patterns of associations between plants and insects are principal components analysis and the clustering techniques of numerical taxonomy, whereby the faunistic similarity among plant species is described. We introduce a weighting factor for cluster analysis that weights a character (in this case the density of an insect species on a plant) in proportion to its deviation from the norm. During June, both the abundance and variety of insects declined on most plant species, which vary greatly in both these aspects of their fauna. Insect species that are either quite highly specialized or generalized in diet appeared to be prevalent; those with intermediate diet breadth were less so. Clustering plant species by faunal similarity revealed some clusters of taxonomically related species, but the correspondence between faunal similarity and taxonomic affinity is not strong. Few plant species have a highly distinct, specialized fauna. The complexity of distribution of insects over plants indicates that insects are responding to many factors that differentiate plant species.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the empirical and theoretical support for the hypothesis that a large proportion of native species richness is required to maximize ecosystem stability and sustain function. This assessment is important for conservation strategies because sustenance of ecosystem functions has been used as an argument for the conservation of species. If ecosystem functions are sustained at relatively low species richness, then arguing for the conservation of ecosystem function, no matter how important in its own right, does not strongly argue for the conservation of species. Additionally, for this to be a strong conservation argument the link between species diversity and ecosystem functions of value to the human community must be clear. We review the empirical literature to quantify the support for two hypotheses: (1) species richness is positively correlated with ecosystem function, and (2) ecosystem functions do not saturate at low species richness relative to the observed or experimental diversity. Few empirical studies demonstrate improved function at high levels of species richness. Second, we analyze recent theoretical models in order to estimate the level of species richness required to maintain ecosystem function. Again we find that, within a single trophic level, most mathematical models predict saturation of ecosystem function at a low proportion of local species richness. We also analyze a theoretical model linking species number to ecosystem stability. This model predicts that species richness beyond the first few species does not typically increase ecosystem stability. One reason that high species richness may not contribute significantly to function or stability is that most communities are characterized by strong dominance such that a few species provide the vast majority of the community biomass. Rapid turnover of species may rescue the concept that diversity leads to maximum function and stability. The role of turnover in ecosystem function and stability has not been investigated. Despite the recent rush to embrace the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem function, we find little support for the hypothesis that there is a strong dependence of ecosystem function on the full complement of diversity within sites. Given this observation, the conservation community should take a cautious view of endorsing this linkage as a model to promote conservation goals.},

The most complex form of social behavior, eusociality, has arisen independently four times within the bees. Subsequent elaborations of the reproductive division of labor inherent to eusociality have led to the evolution of some of the most highly advanced forms of eusociality documented. Likewise, many reversals back to solitary behavior also create substantial variation in sociality within the bees. These replicated, independent origins and losses enable a comparative approach that facilitates the search for common mechanisms underlying transitions from solitary to group living. In this review, we discuss the extensive behavioral variation found within the bees and highlight how the comparative method has improved our understanding of social evolution. Finally, we discuss potential difficulties with this approach and outline promising avenues for future research.},

I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation, but increasing research efforts into macroecology.},

Furthermore, recovery of biodiversity and services can be slow and incomplete. Despite this uncertainty, new methods of ecosystem service valuation are suggesting that the economic benefits of restoration can outweigh costs. Payment for Ecosystem Service schemes could therefore provide incentives for restoration, but require development to ensure biodiversity and multiple services are enhanced and the needs of different stakeholders are met. Such approaches must be implemented widely if new global restoration targets are to be achieved.},

Currently, predictions on the vulnerability of ecological communities to extinction cascades are based on models that focus on bottom-up effects, which cannot capture the effects of extinctions at higher trophic levels. We show, in experimental insect communities, that harvesting of single carnivorous parasitoid species led to a significant increase in extinction rate of other parasitoid species, separated by four trophic links. Harvesting resulted in the release of prey from top-down control, leading to increased interspecific competition at the herbivore trophic level. This resulted in increased extinction rates of non-harvested parasitoid species when their host had become rare relative to other herbivores. The results demonstrate a mechanism for horizontal extinction cascades, and illustrate that altering the relationship between a predator and its prey can cause wide-ranging ripple effects through ecosystems, including unexpected extinctions.},

	abstract = {Prey diversity is thought to mediate the strength of top-down and bottom-up effects, but few experiments directly test this hypothesis. I assembled food webs of bacteria and bacterivorous protist prey in laboratory microcosms with all combinations of five productivity levels, two top predator treatments (present or absent), and three prey compositions. Depauperate food chains contained one of two edible prey species, while more diverse food webs contained both edible prey species plus two additional less-edible/inedible prey. Equilibrium theory predicts that prey diversity should weaken the top-down and bottom-up effects on trophic level biomasses, due to density compensation among prey species. Top-down effects should increase with productivity in food chains, but decrease with productivity in food webs. Results revealed highly dynamic top-down effects, the strength of which varied more over time than among treatments. Further, top-down effects did not merely vary in absolute strength over time, but also in relative strength across different prey compositions and productivity levels. It might be expected that equilibrium models would qualitatively reproduce time-averaged results. However, time-averaged data largely failed to support equilibrium predictions. This failure may reflect strong temporal variability in treatment effects combined with nonlinear density dependence of species’ per-capita growth rates. Strong temporal variability in the strength of top-down effects has not previously been demonstrated, but likely is common in nature as well.},

Because organic farming prohibits the use of agrochemicals, we compared organic vs. conventional farm types to test the hypothesis that agricultural intensification based on high levels of agrochemical use has been a factor in bat population declines. Bat activity and species richness were compared on matched pairs of organic and conventional farms.
* 2Bat activity was quantified using acoustic surveys within specific habitats on farms in southern England and Wales. Eighty-nine per cent of bat passes were identified to species level using artificial neural networks (ANN). A further 9\% were identified to genus.
* 3Total bat activity was significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms. Significantly more bat passes were recorded over water on organic farms than on conventional farms. Foraging activity (quantified in two ways: total feedings buzzes and feeding buzzes per pass) was significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms.
* 4The dominant species on both farm types were Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus. Significantly more passes of Myotis species were recorded on organic farms than on conventional farms. This difference was also significant when water habitats were considered alone.
* 5The activity of both Myotis daubentonii and Myotis brandtii was significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms. The activity of Myotis bechsteinii and Myotis brandtii was significantly higher over organic water habitats than over conventional water habitats. Rhinolophus hipposideros and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were only recorded on organic farms in wooded, arable and pasture habitats.
* 6Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the position of bats as bioindicators and victims of agricultural change. The differences in bat activity between farm types may reflect features such as taller hedgerows and better water quality on organic farms. Higher foraging activity also suggests that habitat quality in terms of prey availability is greater on organic farms. Less intensive farming benefits bats, and as the number of organic enterprises increases it may help to reverse declines in bat populations.},

Several methods have been proposed to overcome these artifacts, but they have the limitation of being based on visitation data, causing interactions involving rare visitor species to remain undersampled. We propose the analysis of food composition in bee trap nests to assess the reliability of network specialization estimates. We compared data from a plant–pollinator network in the Monte Desert of Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Argentina, sampled by visit observation, and data from trap nests sampled at the same time and location. Our study shows that trap nest sampling was good for estimating rare species degree. The rare species in the networks appear to be more specialized than they really are, and the bias in the estimation of the species degree increases with the rareness. The low species degree of these rare species in the visitation networks results from insufficient sampling of the rare interactions, which could have important consequences for network structure.},

	abstract = {* 1We studied the community and food-web structure of trap-nesting insects in restored meadows and at increasing distances within intensively managed grassland at 13 sites in Switzerland to test if declining species diversity correlates with declining interaction diversity and changes in food-web structure.
* 2We analysed 49 quantitative food webs consisting of a total of 1382 trophic interactions involving 39 host/prey insect species and 14 parasitoid/predator insect species. Species richness and abundance of three functional groups, bees and wasps as the lower trophic level and natural enemies as the higher trophic level, were significantly higher in restored than in adjacent intensively managed meadows. Diversity and abundance of specific trophic interactions also declined from restored to intensively managed meadows.
* 3The proportion of attacked brood cells and the mortality of bees and wasps due to natural enemies were significantly higher in restored than in intensively managed meadows. Bee abundance and the rate of attacked brood cells of bees declined with increasing distance from restored meadows. These findings indicate that interaction diversity declines more rapidly than species diversity in our study system.
* 4Quantitative measures of food-web structure (linkage density, interaction diversity, interaction evenness and compartment diversity) were higher in restored than in intensively managed meadows. This was reflected in a higher mean number of host/prey species per consumer species (degree of generalism) in restored than in intensively managed meadows.
* 5The higher insect species and interaction diversity was related to higher plant species richness in restored than in intensively managed meadows. In particular, bees and natural enemies reacted positively to increased plant diversity.
* 6Our findings provide empirical evidence for the theoretical prediction that decreasing species richness at lower trophic levels should reduce species richness at higher trophic levels, and in addition lead to even stronger reductions in interaction diversity at these higher levels. Species at higher trophic levels may thus benefit relatively more than species at lower trophic levels from habitat restoration in the grassland ecosystems studied. We also demonstrate enhanced compartment diversity and lower interaction evenness in restored than in intensively managed meadows, both of which are theoretically positively associated with increased ecosystem stability in restored meadows.},

	abstract = {Plant invasions are a key cause of biodiversity loss and motivate many restoration programs worldwide. We assessed restoration success of an invaded forest in the Azores using two complementary experimental designs: a before–after control–impact (BACI) design compared a restored and a control (unmanipulated) site over three years, while a control–impact (CI) design evaluated the short-term effects of restoration on restored–control replicated pairs. In both designs, a food web approach was used to evaluate both structural and functional aspects of the restoration. Two years after removing alien plants from the BACI design, there were increases in the abundance of native seeds (110\%), herbivorous insects (85\%), insect parasitoids (5\%), and birds (7\%) in the experimental plot compared to the unmanipulated plot. In the CI design, five experimental plots were weeded and paired with five adjacent unmanipulated plots. Immediately following the removal of alien plants within the experimental plots, there was a significant decrease in native plant species, likely attributed to the effect of disturbance. Nevertheless, the production of native seeds increased by 35\% in year 1, and seed production of the focal endemic plant, Ilex perado (holly), increased 159\% in year 2. Weeding increased the survivorship and growth of seedlings transplanted into the plots, particularly those of alien species. Both experiments provide evidence of the positive effects of weeding cascading through the food web from native plants to herbivorous insects, insect parasitoids, and birds. Two aspects that could prove critical to the outcome of restoration programs deserve further attention: most bird-dispersed seeds were alien, and weeding favored alien over native seedling growth.},

Based on the biology, we predicted that the scope for apparent competition would be greatest for the predator and least for the parasitoid guilds.
* 3Separate fully quantitative food webs were constructed for 3 years for the parasitoid guild, 2 years for the pathogen guild and for a single year for the predator guild. The webs were analysed using standard food web statistics designed for binary data, and using information-theory-based metrics that make use of the full quantitative data.
* 4A total of 29 aphid, 24 parasitoid, five entomopathogenic fungi and 13 aphid specialist predator species were recorded in the study. Aphid density varied among years, and two species of aphid were particularly common in different years. Omitting these species, aphid diversity was similar among years.
* 5The parasitoid web showed the lowest connectance while standard food web statistics suggested the pathogen and predator webs had similar levels of connectance. However, when a measure based on quantitative data was used the pathogen web was intermediate between the other two guilds.
* 6There is evidence that a single aphid species had a particularly large effect on the structure of the pathogen food web.
* 7The predator and pathogen webs were not compartmentalized, and the vast majority of parasitoids were connected in a single large compartment.

We ask: 1) whether beta diversity of plants, pollinators, and interactions follow a similar trend across space, and 2) which interaction properties and site characteristics are related to the probability of turnover of pairwise interactions. Geographical distance was positively correlated with plant and interaction beta diversity. We find that locally frequent interactions are more consistent across space and that local flower abundance is important for the realization of pairwise interactions. While the identity of pairwise interactions is highly variable across space, some species-pairs form interactions that are locally frequent and spatially consistent. Such interactions represent cornerstones of interacting communities and deserve special attention from ecologists and conservation planners alike.},

They may recognize the novel plant as a potential host based on similarity of the plant's traits to the traits of one of its native hosts, a similarity that may or may not exhibit phylogenetic signal. Alternatively, herbivores may feed optimally, assessing which introduced plants provide the best nutrition irrespective of similarity to native species. Here, we created a phylogeny of 57 oak (Quercus) taxa, which were grown outside of their ranges in a common botanical garden that contained one abundant native oak (Quercus lobata). We used the phylogeny to estimate the phylogenetic conservatism of herbivory by two feeding guilds of insects (leaf chewers and leaf miners) and 11 plant traits expected to affect herbivore performance. We found high phylogenetic signal in chewing damage but not mining damage and all traits except for leaf maturation time. Introduced oaks that are more closely related to the native oak received more chewing and mining damage than distantly related oaks, and introduced oaks that had greater overall similarity in leaf traits also received higher chewing damage but not mining damage. These results demonstrate that interactions between introduced plants and their herbivores are driven independently by traits that track plant phylogeny and leaf traits that likely affect herbivore performance.},

	abstract = {Loss of species will directly change the structure and potentially the dynamics of ecological communities, which in turn may lead to additional species loss (secondary extinctions) due to direct and/or indirect effects (e.g. loss of resources or altered population dynamics). Furthermore, the vulnerability of food webs to repeated species loss is expected to be affected by food web topology, species interactions, as well as the order in which species go extinct. Species traits such as body size, abundance and connectivity might determine a species’ vulnerability to extinction and, thus, the order in which species go primarily extinct. Yet, the sequence of primary extinctions, and their effects on the vulnerability of food webs to secondary extinctions, when species abundances are allowed to respond dynamically, has only recently become the focus of attention. Here, we analyse and compare topological and dynamical robustness to secondary extinctions of model food webs, in the face of 34 extinction sequences based on species traits. Although secondary extinctions are frequent in the dynamical approach and rare in the topological approach, topological and dynamical robustness tends to be correlated for many bottom–up directed, but not for top–down directed deletion sequences. Furthermore, removing species based on traits that are strongly positively correlated to the trophic position of species (such as large body size, low abundance, high net effect) is, under the dynamical approach, found to be as destructive as removing primary producers. Such top–down oriented removal of species are often considered to correspond to realistic extinction scenarios, but earlier studies, based on topological approaches, have found such extinction sequences to have only moderate effects on the remaining community. Thus, our result suggests that the structure of ecological communities, and therefore the integrity of important ecosystem processes could be more vulnerable to realistic extinction sequences than previously believed.},

	abstract = {* Grassland for livestock production is a major form of land use throughout Europe and its intensive management threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes. Modest increases to conventional grassland biodiversity could have considerable positive impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, such as pollination, to surrounding habitats.


* Using a field-scale experiment in which grassland seed mixes and sward management were manipulated, complemented by surveys on working farms and phytometer experiments, the impact of conventional grassland diversity and management on the functional diversity and ecosystem service provision of pollinator communities were investigated.


* Increasing plant richness, by the addition of both legumes and forbs, was associated with significant enhancements in the functional diversity of grassland pollinator communities. This was associated with increased temporal stability of flower–visitor interactions at the community level. Visitation networks revealed pasture species Taraxacum sp. (Wigg.) (dandelion) and Cirsium arvense (Scop.) (creeping thistle) to have the highest pollinator visitation frequency and richness. Cichorium intybus (L.) (chichory) was highlighted as an important species having both high pollinator visitation and desirable agronomic properties.


* Increased sward richness was associated with an increase in the pollination of two phytometer species; Fragaria × ananassa (strawberry) and Silene dioica (red campion), but not Vicia faba (broad bean). Enhanced functional diversity, richness and abundance of the pollinator communities associated with more diverse neighbouring pastures were found to be potential mechanisms for improved pollination.


* Synthesis and applications. A modest increase in conventional grassland plant diversity with legumes and forbs, achievable with the expertise and resources available to most grassland farmers, could enhance pollinator functional diversity, richness and abundance. Moreover, our results suggest that this could improve pollination services and consequently surrounding crop yields (e.g. strawberry) and wildflower reproduction in agro-ecosystems.},

We studied the spatial and temporal use of floral resources by bumble bees in a set of 30 local plant communities and used these data to model colony survival under different combinations of patch size and bumble bee flight distance. Floral resources vary spatially and temporally at the landscape level, and bumble bees track these resources across the landscape during the season. The simulation model showed that different patterns of resources availability could affect the survival and distribution of bumble bee nests across the landscape. This model can be used to generate hypotheses explaining bumble bee richness and abundance that can be tested in real landscapes. Integrating the spatial and temporal dynamics of the flower resources used by bumble bees provides a new perspective that can be used to inform bumble bee conservation, particularly in the context of their widespread decline in recent decades.},

	abstract = {Intensified exploitation of natural populations and habitats has led to increased mortality rates and decreased abundances of many species. There is a growing concern that this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species to be crossed, with extinction cascades and state shifts in ecosystems as a consequence. When increased mortality rate and decreased abundance of a given species lead to extinction of other species, this species can be characterized as functionally extinct even though it still exists. Although such functional extinctions have been observed in some ecosystems, their frequency is largely unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore the frequency and pattern of functional extinctions in ecological networks. Specifically, we analytically derive critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing their mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the network. Applying this approach on natural and theoretical food webs, we show that the species most likely to go extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is increased but instead another species. Indeed, up to 80\% of all first extinctions are of another species, suggesting that a species/' ecological functionality is often lost before its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we find that large-bodied species at the top of the food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend strong support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological functionality rather than on mere persistence.},

The relationship between plant species diversity and ecosystem productivity is controversial. The debate concerns whether diversity peaks at intermediate levels of productivity—the so-called humped-back model—or whether there is no clear predictable relationship. Fraser et al. used a large, standardized, and geographically diverse sample of grasslands from six continents to confirm the validity and generality of the humped-back model. Their findings pave the way for a more mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling species diversity.
Science, this issue p. 302
The search for predictions of species diversity across environmental gradients has challenged ecologists for decades. The humped-back model (HBM) suggests that plant diversity peaks at intermediate productivity; at low productivity few species can tolerate the environmental stresses, and at high productivity a few highly competitive species dominate. Over time the HBM has become increasingly controversial, and recent studies claim to have refuted it. Here, by using data from coordinated surveys conducted throughout grasslands worldwide and comprising a wide range of site productivities, we provide evidence in support of the HBM pattern at both global and regional extents. The relationships described here provide a foundation for further research into the local, landscape, and historical factors that maintain biodiversity.
The humped-back model of plant species diversity is confirmed by a global grassland survey.

	abstract = {Disentangling the processes that shape the organization of ecological assemblages and its implications for species coexistence is one of the foremost challenges of ecology. Although insightful advances have recently related community composition and structure with species coexistence in mutualistic and antagonistic networks, little is known regarding other species assemblages, such as those of scavengers exploiting carrion. Here we studied seven assemblages of scavengers feeding on ungulate carcasses in mainland Spain. We used dynamical models to investigate if community composition, species richness and structure (nestedness) affect species coexistence at carcasses. Scavenging networks showed a nested pattern in sites where highly efficient, obligate scavengers (i.e., vultures) were present and a non-nested pattern everywhere else. Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) and certain meso-facultative mammalian scavengers (i.e., red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and stone marten, Martes foina) were the main species contributing to nestedness. Assemblages with vultures were also the richest ones in species. Nested species-rich assemblages with vulture presence were associated with high carcass consumption rates, indicating higher interspecific competition at the local scale. However, the proportion of species stopping the consumption of carrion (as derived from the competitive dynamic model) stabilized at high richness and nestedness levels. This suggests that high species richness and nestedness may characterize scavenging networks that are robust to high levels of interspecific competition for carrion. Some facilitative interactions driven by vultures and major facultative scavengers could be behind these observations. Our findings are relevant for understanding species’ coexistence in highly competitive systems.},

	abstract = {* Land managers choose seed from a variety of provenances for restoration projects. By selecting seed of the local ecotype, managers can increase establishment in the short term and prevent the disruption of local adaptations and genetic swamping in the long term. However, local seed may be disadvantageous if populations are inbred or maladapted to managed restoration environments. Seed selection may be further confounded by propagation methods.


* Three dominant C4 grasses, Andropogon gerardii, Bouteloua curtipendula and Sorghastrum nutans, from three types of seed provenances (remnant, restoration and nursery) were planted as seeds and plugs into experimental plots at three established tallgrass prairie restorations in western Minnesota, USA. Using a common garden design, we tested whether (i) provenance and (ii) site of planting influence germination and first-season survival and growth both (iii) for seeds directly planted in the field and for transplants (plugs).


* Seed provenance impacted germination and seedling survival in all cases, except S. nutans seeded directly in the field. Andropogon gerardii and B. curtipendula nursery seedlings were consistently taller than those of the other provenance types.


* When directly seeded, germination, survival and vigour differed among restoration sites; however, the results were species specific. Sorghastrum nutans germination varied among sites depending on provenance, indicating that this species may be particularly sensitive to environmental conditions.


* Germination was 3–12 times greater for plugs than for seeds directly planted in the field in summer, but mortality after planting in the field was low for both groups.


* Synthesis and applications. Provenance and restoration site had varying effects among species, indicating that the dominant C4 grasses used in this study ought not to be considered ecological equivalents. While we found little evidence of local adaptation, use of local remnant seeds diminishes the risk of spreading maladapted genotypes. Germination limited establishment when sowing seeds directly in summer. Supplemental use of plugs may increase species diversity in restorations.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is quantified via richness (e.g., the number of species), evenness (the relative abundance distribution of those species), or proportional diversity (a combination of richness and evenness, such as the Shannon index, H′). While empirical studies show no consistent relationship between these aspects of biodiversity within communities, the mechanisms leading to inconsistent relationships have received little attention. Here, using common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) and its associated arthropod community, we show that relationships between arthropod richness, evenness, and proportional diversity are altered by plant genotypic richness. Arthropod richness increased with O. biennis genotypic richness due to an abundance-driven accumulation of species in response to greater plant biomass. Arthropod evenness and proportional diversity decreased with plant genotypic richness due to a nonadditive increase in abundance of a dominant arthropod, the generalist florivore/omnivore Plagiognathas politus (Miridae). The greater quantity of flowers and buds produced in polycultures—which resulted from positive complementarity among O. biennis genotypes—increased the abundance of this dominant insect. Using choice bioassays, we show that floral quality did not change in plant genotypic mixtures. These results elucidate mechanisms for how plant genotypic richness can modify relationships between arthropod richness, evenness, and proportional diversity. More broadly, our results suggest that trophic interactions may be a previously underappreciated factor controlling relationships between these different aspects of biodiversity.},

We tested the prediction that we are more likely to create persistent, species-rich plant communities by increasing the number of species sown, and, to some degree, by varying functional group representation, in experimental prairie plantings. There were 12 treatments consisting of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-species mixtures of native perennials representing four functional groups (C4 grasses, C3 grasses, nitrogen-fixing species, and late-flowering composites) that predominate within Central Plains tallgrass prairies. In 2000, species were seeded into square plots (6 × 6 m), with five replicates per treatment, on former agricultural land. Annually, we measured total species richness and evenness, target species richness and cover, and richness and cover of resident species (i.e., those emerging from the seed bank). Both target species richness and rate of establishment of target communities were highest in the most species-rich mixtures, but there was no additional benefit for treatments that contained more than eight species. Richness of resident species did not vary with target species richness; however, cover by resident species was lower in the higher target species treatments. Our results, indicating that establishment of species-rich prairie mimics can be enhanced by starting with larger numbers of species at the outset, have implications for grassland restoration in which community biodiversity creation and maintenance are key goals.},

	abstract = {Downscaling networks from species to individuals is a useful approach to incorporate inter-individual variation and to investigate whether topology of species-based networks results from processes acting at the scale of individuals, such as foraging behaviour. Here, we analyzed pollen-transport networks at two scales, i.e. pollinator species–plant species (sp–sp) and pollinator individuals–plant species (i–sp), and assessed whether modularity – a prevalent pattern in most pollination networks – is consistent across both scales. To test this we use three different algorithms developed for the calculation of modularity (unipartite, bipartite and weighted bipartite modularity) and compare the results obtained. Downscaling networks revealed a higher modular structure in i–sp networks than in sp–sp networks, regardless of the modular metric used. Using a null model approach, we show that modularity at the individual scale is originated by the existence of a high heterogeneity and specialization in the partition of pollen resources among conspecific individuals, a pattern which obviously cannot be observed at the species level. Modules in i–sp networks consisted of individuals sometimes neither taxonomically nor functionally related, but sharing common pollen resources at different moments of the flowering season. Interestingly, conspecific individuals may belong to different modules. Both plant and insect phenologies were important drivers of the modularity detected in individual-based networks, even determining the topological roles of nodes in the networks. A temporal turnover of modules was identified, i.e. modules of individuals assembled and disassembled over time as species modify their foraging choices throughout the flowering season adjusting to ecological conditions. Downscaling from species to individual-based networks is a promising approach to study the interplay among structural patterns and processes at different, but interdependent organizational levels.},

Ex-arable fields have been suggested as potential sites for re-creation of semi-natural grasslands, but information is still limited on the temporal scales needed for the natural assembly of these communities and whether colonization is related to dispersal or establishment limitation. 2. We investigated grazed ex-arable fields of different age and adjacent semi-natural grasslands in terms of species richness of plants, community similarity, colonization pattern and recruitment ability of 16 sown grassland species. The functional trait distribution of successful and unsuccessful colonizing species was compared using five traits related to dispersal and persistence: seed mass, seed bank persistence, specific leaf area, plant height and potential for lateral spread. 3. The youngest ex-arable fields had the lowest species richness and contained communities with the lowest similarity to semi-natural grassland. Species richness and similarity to semi-natural grassland both increased with time since grazing strated on ex-arable fields, but were still significantly lower than in semi-natural grasslands even after more than 50 years of grazing. 4. Colonization was not related to any of the investigated functional traits. The rank order of the species in terms of abudance was correlated between young and old ex-arables fields suggesting that species performance remains the same with field age. 5. Recruitment after sowing was generally lower in ex-arable fields than in semi-natural grasslands, although the basic recruitment ability varied between species. Recruitment did not change with field age, suggesting that dispersal limitation rather than establishment limitation caused the temporal pattern of colonization. However, establishment limitation may act as a filter for colonization of all ex-arable fields, regardless of their age. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the temporal scale for natural assembly of semi-natural grassland communities in ex-arable fields extends over 50 years, even when source pools are nearby. Results suggest that a field age-independent establishment limitation, combined with dispersal limitation, cause the delayed assembly in ex-arable fields. Management that aims to re-create semi-natural grassland communities in ex-arable fields should consider introducing seeds or improving germination conditions at the sites.},

	abstract = {Ecological restoration aims to revitalize ecosystem integrity and functionality following severe damage or degradation. Often, however, efforts are hampered by an incomplete or flawed concept of historical ‘reference’ used when choosing or constructing a target ecosystem or landscape to restore ‘to’. This problem may stem from a culturally-skewed interpretation of history or from misunderstanding or underestimation of the role that humans have played in a given ecosystem’s historical development and dynamics. While strongly confirming the importance of the reference concept in restoration ecology, we argue for the need to refine it, and to broaden the ways it can be conceived, developed, and applied. Firstly, the historical reference system informing a given restoration project should be grounded in both latent and active ‘ecological memories’, encoded and stored across relevant geographical and temporal scales. Further, the generally neglected geomorphic component of reference-building should also be addressed, as well as the contributions of human cultures to current ecosystem and landscape condition. Thirdly, ecosystems are historically contingent and multi-layered. Pre- versus post-disturbance comparisons are insufficient. Instead, restoration scenarios should be seen as tapestries of multiple and successive states. In sum, a well-conceived reference model helps promote and ensure the recovery and subsequent maintenance of historical continuity, i.e., the reestablishment of an impaired ecosystem to its historic ecological trajectory. We use case studies from Spain and Peru to illustrate how this approach can provide better goalposts and benchmarks, and therefore better guide the planning, implementation, and evaluation of effective restoration projects.},

Simultaneously conserving richness and evenness might be difficult, however, if, for example, the restoration of previously absent species to low densities brings a cost in reduced evenness. Using meta-analysis, we searched for benefits to biodiversity following adoption of two common land-management schemes: the implementation of organic practices by farmers and of controlled burning by natural-land managers. We used rarefaction to eliminate sampling bias in all of our estimates of richness and evenness. Both conservation practices significantly increased evenness and overall abundance across taxonomic classifications (arthropods, birds, non-bird vertebrates, plants, soil organisms). Evenness and richness varied independently, leading to no richness–evenness correlation and no significant overall change in richness. Demonstrating the importance of rarefaction, analyses of raw data that did not receive rarefaction indicated misleadingly strong benefits of organic agriculture and burning for richness while underestimating true gains in evenness. Both organic farming and burning favored species that were not numerically dominant, re-balancing communities as uncommon species gained individuals. Our results support the assertion that richness and evenness capture separate facets of biodiversity, each needing individual attention during conservation.},

	abstract = {Calluna vulgaris-dominated heaths and moorlands are habitats of international conservation importance. Degradation has occurred throughout their range with Calluna typically being replaced by grass species. The cessation of grazing is often impractical and rarely results in the recovery of Calluna abundance when it is initially present at low cover. Thus the development of restoration methods is required; these should be practical at a large-scale, in remote areas and create suitable conditions for Calluna germination and establishment, whilst still allowing grazing to occur. A replicated field experiment was established on Nardus stricta and Molinia caerulea-dominated moorlands to test the efficacy of different grazing regimes and intervention techniques aimed at establishing Calluna. Disturbance (rotavation and trampling by animals) to create bare ground increased Calluna establishment. On the Nardus site, Calluna establishment was equally successful on rotavated and trampled plots, but rotavation was more successful on the Molinia site. Seeding with Calluna increased Calluna establishment irrespective of whether a seed-bank was present. At the Nardus site, 0.5 cow/ha for two months in summer led to Calluna establishment and growth similar to that of ungrazed plots and was more successful than a mixed grazing regime (1 ewe/ha plus 0.5 cow/ha for 2 months) or a sheep only regime (1.5 ewes/ha). The creation of small patches of bare ground, seed addition and low intensity grazing enabled the rapid establishment of Calluna on grass-dominated moorlands; such techniques may also be applicable in other habitats where restoration requires the addition of a single/few species and minimal intervention.},

Indeed, the proportion of pollinator-dependent crops is increasing globally. Agriculture relies heavily on the domesticated honeybee; the services provided by this single species are under threat and becoming increasingly costly. Importantly, the free pollination services provided by diverse wild bee communities have been shown to be sufficient for high agricultural yields in some systems. However, stable, functional wild bee communities require floral resources, such as pollen and nectar, throughout their active season, not just when crop species are in flower. To target floral provisioning efforts to conserve and support native and managed bee species, we apply network theoretical methods incorporating plant and pollinator phenologies. Using a two-year dataset comprising interactions between bees (superfamily Apoidea, Anthophila) and 25 native perennial plant species in floral provisioning habitat, we identify plant and bee species that provide a key and central role to the stability of the structure of this community. We also examine three specific case studies: how provisioning habitat can provide temporally continuous support for honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus impatiens), and how resource supplementation strategies might be designed for a single genus of important orchard pollinators (Osmia). This framework could be used to provide native bee communities with additional, well-targeted floral resources to ensure that they not only survive, but also thrive.},

Nearly all (98\%) sown target species successfully established and nearly half of unsown target species established spontaneously, partly dependent on distance to the ancient grasslands. Early mowing in the first half of June appeared to support species diversity and broad-leaved forbs at the expense of competitive grasses. Using a regional seed mixture appeared to be an effective way of restoring dry grasslands and is especially recommended in the proximity of still existing ancient grasslands where spontaneous establishment of unsown target species may reinforce the success of restoration more easily.},

	abstract = {Networks of trophic links (food webs) are used to describe and understand mechanistic routes for translocation of energy (biomass) between species. However, a relatively low proportion of ecosystems have been studied using food web approaches due to difficulties in making observations on large numbers of species. In this paper we demonstrate that Machine Learning of food webs, using a logic-based approach called A/ILP, can generate plausible and testable food webs from field sample data. Our example data come from a national-scale Vortis suction sampling of invertebrates from arable fields in Great Britain. We found that 45 invertebrate species or taxa, representing approximately 25\% of the sample and about 74\% of the invertebrate individuals included in the learning, were hypothesized to be linked. As might be expected, detritivore Collembola were consistently the most important prey. Generalist and omnivorous carabid beetles were hypothesized to be the dominant predators of the system. We were, however, surprised by the importance of carabid larvae suggested by the machine learning as predators of a wide variety of prey. High probability links were hypothesized for widespread, potentially destabilizing, intra-guild predation; predictions that could be experimentally tested. Many of the high probability links in the model have already been observed or suggested for this system, supporting our contention that A/ILP learning can produce plausible food webs from sample data, independent of our preconceptions about “who eats whom.” Well-characterised links in the literature correspond with links ascribed with high probability through A/ILP. We believe that this very general Machine Learning approach has great power and could be used to extend and test our current theories of agricultural ecosystem dynamics and function. In particular, we believe it could be used to support the development of a wider theory of ecosystem responses to environmental change.},

However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species. Networks of feeding interactions (food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function. Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps. The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans.},

To date, there has been a limited amount of research investigating farmers' values through the ecosystem services concept, particularly in Australia. In this paper we address this research gap through focusing on farmers' perceptions of four different attributes towards 12 ecosystem services. Results from our survey indicate that farmers place a high value on the importance of all ecosystem services, whilst perceiving most of them to be moderately manageable. The farmers identified a variety of threats towards ecosystem services that were mostly agricultural in origin, whilst perceiving themselves to be moderately vulnerable to the loss of services. To overcome any potential loss of services, market-based instruments such as schemes paying for ecosystem services can be applied. These economic tools do appear to be needed, as the farmers in this study directly identified the economic cost of maintaining native habitat as a threat. Through more explicit understanding of the social dimension of the two-way relationship between ecosystem services and agricultural production, natural resource policies to overcome this potential negative cycle can be implemented more effectively.},

Theory predicts that differences in prey preferences among consumers and/or differences in the likelihood of adding new resources to their diets are key mechanisms underlying intrapopulation variation in resource use. We developed network models based on optimal diet theory that simulate how individuals consume resources under varying scenarios of individual variation in prey preferences and in the willingness of consuming alternate resources. We then investigated how the structure of individual–resource networks generated under each model compared to the structure of observed networks representing five classical examples of individual diet variation. Our results support the notion that, for the studied populations, individual variation in prey preferences is the major factor explaining patterns in individual–resource networks. In contrast, variation in the willingness of adding prey does not seem to play an important role in shaping patterns of resource use. Individual differences in prey preferences in the studied populations may be generated by complex behavioral rules related to cognitive constraints and experience. Our approach provides a pathway for mapping foraging models into network patterns, which may allow determining the possible mechanisms leading to variation in resource use within populations.},

	abstract = {Most tree species rely on vertebrates for seed dispersal, and many vertebrates use fruits as food resources in tropical forests. Therefore, plant–frugivore interactions affect population dynamics and persistence in ecological communities. Plant–frugivore interactions often involve many species, forming networks of interacting plants and animals that play different roles in determining network organization. The network organization is the way interactions are structured in the community, which may have consequences for its ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Some species have greater influences on network organization and may be particularly important to species persistence. We identified the frugivores most important to the organization of networks of plants and frugivorous birds in three contiguous Atlantic forest sites in southeastern Brazil. We found that the species that contributed most to network organization were at higher risk of extinction. Among the main contributors to network organization were two cotingas and a toucan, large-bodied species that disperse seeds from many plants and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting. As a consequence, ongoing extinctions may significantly affect the organization of plant–frugivore interactions in the studied system. We hypothesize that the crucial role of some threatened frugivores may occur in other seed dispersal systems in tropical communities, although the association between structural importance and degree of threat may be contingent on peculiarities of local communities and disturbances.},

The remaining woodland consists mainly of small, highly fragmented woodland patches within farmland. A number of agri-environment schemes aim to increase the amount and quality of woodland on agricultural land, but there is limited information on associations between moths and woodland characteristics which can be used to produce practical recommendations for woodland creation and management. We studied micro- and macromoth communities in woodland patches within farmland to assess the effects of woodland vegetation character and patch configuration. In addition, we measured the influence of the surrounding landscape to assess the potential importance of a landscape-scale management approach for moth conservation. In general, high tree species diversity and a high proportion of native tree species were related to higher moth abundance and species richness; there was a negative impact of grazing. Moth abundance and richness were higher in large woodland patches located close to other woodlands. Woodlands of compact shapes (with proportionally less edge exposed to the surrounding matrix) had higher numbers of ‘woodland species’, which were associated with woodland core habitat. Small woodland patches can potentially maintain relatively high moth abundance and richness, depending on their shape and proximity to other woodlands. Woodland extent was the most important landscape parameter influencing moths, mostly at relatively small spatial scales (⩽500 m); macromoth ‘woodland species’ were influenced by woodland extent at larger spatial scales (⩽1500 m) and are more likely to benefit from a landscape-scale management approach. Our results have important implications for the design and management of woodland patches of high conservation value within agricultural land.},

This has triggered calls for further study of these mutualistic communities in order to more effectively inform restoration of disturbed plant–pollinator communities. Here, we use a dynamic network model to test a variety of translocation strategies for restoring a community after it experiences the loss of some of its species. We consider the reintroduction of extirpated species, both immediately after the original loss and after the community has reequilibrated, as well as the introduction of other native species that were originally absent from the community. We find that reintroducing multiple highly interacting generalist species best restores species richness for lightly disturbed communities. However, for communities that experience significant losses in biodiversity, introducing generalist species that are not originally present in the community may most effectively restore species richness, although in these cases the resultant community often shares few species with the original community. We also demonstrate that the translocation of a single species has a minimal impact on both species richness and the frequency of community collapse. These results have important implications for restoration practices in the face of varying degrees of community perturbations, the refinement of which is crucial for community management.},

Descriptors have been used to extract ecologically meaningful information from such data, e.g., the proportion of top species (the proportion of taxa without consumers) or vulnerability (the average number of consumers per taxon). Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices. Two versions of each quantitative descriptor are proposed, one giving the same weight to each taxon, and one weighting each taxon by the total amount of its incoming and outgoing biomass flows. We use a published quantitative food web to exemplify the computation of the new descriptors, and discuss their potential and limitations.},

Realistic extinction sequences of plants, incorporating red-list status, range size, and native status, altered subsequent Lepidoptera extinctions. We compared simulated Lepidoptera extinctions to the number of actual regional Lepidoptera extinctions and found that all predicted scenarios underestimated total observed extinctions but accurately predicted observed extinctions attributed to host loss (n = 8, 14\%). Likely, many regional Lepidoptera extinctions occurred for reasons other than loss of host plant alone, such as climate change and habitat loss. Ecological networks can be useful in assessing a component of extinction risk to herbivores based on host loss, but further factors may be equally important.},

Ecological restoration aims to rebuild this biome and should include not only the reinstatement of species but also the reestablishment of complex ecological interactions and the ecological functions that they provide. One such function is seed dispersal, which is provided by the interactions between animal frugivores and plants. We studied seed dispersal networks in 3 different tropical forest sites restored 15, 25, and 57 years ago; temporal scales rarely observed in restoration studies. We investigated changes in network structure (nestedness, modularity, and network specialization) in these communities over restoration time. Although network size and the number of interactions increased with time since restoration, the networks were composed of generalist birds, and the large frugivores remained absent. Contrary to our expectations though, species richness was highest in the 25-year-old site, maybe due to the higher number of species used in the planting. Nestedness values were low in all 3 networks, but the highest nestedness was observed in the intermediate-aged site. However, the oldest network was significantly modular and showed higher complementary specialization. These results suggest that 57 years after restoration, the complexity of mutualistic interactions in seed dispersal networks has increased, this enhancing ecosystem function in the Atlantic forest.},

	abstract = {Complementary resource use and redundancy of species that fulfill the same ecological role are two mechanisms that can respectively increase and stabilize process rates in ecosystems. For example, predator complementarity and redundancy can determine prey consumption rates and their stability, yet few studies take into account the multiple predator species attacking multiple prey at different rates in natural communities. Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator–prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines community-wide consumption and stability. Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional complementarity. Our study shows that known mechanisms underpinning predator diversity effects on both functioning and stability can easily be extended to link food webs to ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {1. Large-scale destruction of ecosystems caused by surface mining provides an opportunity for the study of colonization processes starting with primary succession. Surprisingly, over several decades and without any restoration measures, most of these sites spontaneously developed into valuable biotope mosaics with many endangered plant species. 2. Investigations were carried out in 10 open-cast mined sites. Data from extensive floristic mapping of mined sites and their surroundings were combined with functional traits. 3. Using binary logistic regression, we showed that eight variables have a significant influence on the probability of the occurence of particular plant species in mined sites. The regional species pool explained the highest proportion of variance. Further significant variables were distance of source populations, abundance in the habitat species pool, capacity for long-distance dispersal by wind and birds, terminal velocity of seeds and requirements for light and nitrogen. 4. In the 10 study mine sites, 143 establishing events of Red List species have been recorded. For 40\% of these establishing events, the nearest recorded seed source is 3-10 km away, while for 19\%, the distance to the nearest seed source exceeds 10 km. 5. This study showed for the first time that the abundance of species up to a distance of at least 17 km plays an important role in colonization processes following large-scale destruction of ecosystems. In large-scale, nutrient-deficient, open sites, an accumulation of plant species, including rare species, can be expected in time frames amenable to planning (several decades), because the sites acted as huge seed traps in the landscape. 6. Synthesis and applications. The floristic colonization probability of restoration sites is higher if large-scale, open and nutrient-poor habitats are available. In regions where such habitats have become highly fragmented, restoration planning of derelict land (e.g. surface mines, quarries, landfills) that supports the creation of such conditions can contribute to the regional survival of rare pioneer species. In future restoration planning, a new protocol must be established that combines the utilization of site potential with spontaneous colonization processes.},

	abstract = {Restoration is a young and swiftly developing field. It has been almost a decade since the inception of one of the field's foundational documents—the Society for Ecological Restoration International Primer on Ecological Restoration (Primer). Through a series of organized discussions, we assessed the Primer for its currency and relevance in the modern field of ecological restoration. We focused our assessment on the section entitled “The Nine Attributes of a Restored Ecosystem” and grouped each of the attributes into one of four categories: species composition, ecosystem function, ecosystem stability, and landscape context. We found that in the decade since the document's inception, the concepts, methods, goals, and thinking of ecological restoration have shifted significantly. We discuss each of the four categories in this light with the aim of offering comments and suggestions on options for updating the Primer. We also include a fifth category that we believe is increasingly acknowledged in ecological restoration: the human element. The Primer is an important document guiding the practice of restoration. We hope that this critical assessment contributes to its ongoing development and relevance and more generally to the development of restoration ecology, particularly in our current era of rapid environmental change.},

We mapped the complex network of interactions between herbivores and parasitoids to examine the relationship between parasitoid species richness, functional group diversity and the provision of natural pest control services. Quantitative food webs were constructed for 10 organic and 10 conventional farms. Parasitoid species richness varied from 26 to 58 species and we found a significant positive relationship between parasitoid species richness and temporal stability in parasitism rates. Higher species richness was associated with lower variation in parasitism rate. A functional group analysis showed significantly greater parasitoid species complementarity on organic farms, with on average more species in each functional group. We simulated parasitoid removal to predict whether organic farms experienced greater robustness of parasitism in the face of local extinctions. This analysis showed no consistent differences between the organic and conventional farm pairs in terms of loss of pest control service. Finally, it was found that the different habitats that make up each farm do not contribute equally to parasitoid species diversity, and that hedgerows produced more parasitoid species, significantly more so on organic farms.},

	abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a mess, given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of speciesthe subject matter of community ecologyare influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

Actions that increase or protect biodiversity in an agricultural landscape will often indirectly help preserve ecosystem services, but actions that focus on enhancing ecosystem services will not necessarily provide good outcomes for biodiversity. 5. Synthesis and applications. Synergies between agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation can only be achieved if an understanding of ecosystem services leads to a change in management practice that supports greater biodiversity.},

Here, we evaluate if, and to what extend, dual-purpose wetlands benefit local and regional diversity of agricultural landscapes. We analysed composition and α, β, and γ diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among dual-purpose wetlands in an agricultural region in southwest Sweden in relation to local (water quality, wetland morphology, succession stage, proximity to other aquatic habitats) and landscape parameters (regional connectivity, wetland density). Diversity of mature agricultural ponds was used as a standard to evaluate the value of dual-purpose wetlands. Dual-purpose wetlands sustained α, β, and γ diversity similar to that of natural lentic water bodies in agricultural landscapes in the region and elsewhere. Over 80\% of the overall species richness was attributed to β diversity, and each created wetland contributed to overall species accumulation. Ecosystem parameters explained 19\% of the compositional variation among assemblages, but were only marginally related to diversity. Wetland density promoted α and γ diversity, while spatial heterogeneity (β) remained equally high, independent of wetland density. Our results indicate that catchment-scale wetland creation for simultaneous retention and diversity purposes benefits the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes, particularly if the density of aquatic habitats is increased by at least 30\%.},

	abstract = {Restoring native habitat is considered critical to conserving native pollinators threatened by habitat loss and degradation, but little is known about whether ecological restorations, most of which do not target pollinators, can predictably support pollinator communities. In this study we compare plant species richness in common commercial prairie seed mixes to remnant prairies, and we take a modeling approach to examine the ability of these seed mixes to attract bee communities relative to native prairie remnants. Using a large data set from native prairies in Iowa consisting of 70 bee species (≈2700 bee specimens) associated with 54 native prairie plants, we constructed species accumulation curves to model the number of bee species potentially attracted to a restoration with the addition of each plant in a seed mix. Our modeling results indicate commercial prairie mixes will accumulate species at rates similar to prairie remnants, but the bee species richness will be lower than remnants because the plant species richness in samples from prairie remnants is twice that of the average commercial seed mix. However, when commercially available seed mixes were modeled to always include four plant species that were exceptionally attractive to native bee species, most mixes attracted significantly more bees than predicted if random species were added. This further suggests that seed mixes and the resulting restorations do not adequately provide for pollinators and could be significantly improved with the addition of a small number of species. Although the particular optimal species additions to seed mixes will vary regionally, adding species functionally equivalent to those we identify may significantly improve restoration of ecological services provided by native bees.},

	abstract = {European lowland heaths have declined by up to 80\% due to land use change and lack of management. There has been considerable research into the restoration of this threatened habitat. However, long-term outcomes of restoration are poorly understood, especially in situations where past agricultural land use imposes severe constraints on community re-assembly. In 1989 a large-scale experiment was established to examine the effectiveness of five treatments to restore heathland on formerly productive grassland: (i) natural regeneration; (ii) herbicide application to facilitate regeneration; (iii) cultivation and application of seed-rich heathland vegetation; (iv) soil removal and incorporation of heathland topsoil; and (v) heathland translocation. After 17 years the pH of the unamended agricultural soil remained significantly higher than that of the adjacent heathland. All treatments showed different trajectories of vegetation change in the long-term. Natural colonisation by heathland species was slow due to seed limitation, resulting in formation of an acid grassland community. Heathland community assembly was not facilitated by destruction of the initial grassland with herbicide. Incorporation of topsoil had an intermediate effect on pH reduction. This may explain the subsequent failure of the plant community to assemble in the anticipated proportions, and the dominance of leguminous scrub species (Ulex spp.). Turf translocation was effective in reducing pH to the required range and restoring the heathland community in the long-term. However, this technique should only be considered as a means of ‘rescue’ when habitat destruction is otherwise unavoidable. The only practical and sustainable means of increasing heathland extent on former farmland is the application of seed-bearing vegetation cut as part of routine management. However, this technique needs refining in order to establish the full range of characteristic heathland species.},

Whilst several studies have investigated how bees and wasps (aculeates) respond to management at the scale of the scheme (i.e. within the flower patch) there has been little assessment of how schemes affect diversity at the farm scale. In the current work we assessed whether farms implementing flower-rich schemes had richer aculeate communities than farms without such habitats. A total of 104 species of bee and 44 species of aculeate wasp were recorded. Farms providing flower-rich habitats had significantly greater floral abundance but there were no differences in the total number of aculeate or flowering plant species recorded compared to farms without these habitats. After accounting for differences in sample size, and contrary to expectations, farms without flower-rich habitats were significantly richer in aculeate and flowering plant species. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and honeybees (Apis mellifera) foraged strongly from sown flowers, but the majority of bee species preferred wild plants that are not included in flower-rich schemes such as Heracleum sphondylium, Hypochaeris radicata and Tripleurospermum inodorum. The creation of pollinator-friendly habitats has not increased the diversity of flowering plants and such schemes will consequently only benefit a limited suite of aculeate species. If diverse aculeate communities are to be retained and restored on farmland, agri-environment schemes that provide foraging and nesting resources for a wider range of pollinator species must be developed.},

The aim was to discover whether enhancement had produced a community intermediate to nonenhanced plantations and naturally established woodland. Enhancement had not successfully created plantations botanically more woodland-like and plantation types were not constant; however, plant species richness had increased. This was also true of the insect assemblages (Coleoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera), which showed more variation in composition, though woodland communities could still be distinguished. However, those insect species present in the naturally established woods did have a significantly greater frequency and abundance in the enhanced plantations compared to the nonenhanced plantations, especially so with “woodland edge” species. Mantel tests showed significant correlations between the plant species present and insect assemblages taken by both sampling types. Although insect species richness was not significantly higher in the enhanced plantations, this correlated strongly with plant species richness and a measure of vegetation volume. The overall findings suggest that the enhancement had created plantations only subtly more like the local woodlands, though the insect assemblages had responded. However, relative to the time scale of woodland development, it is still early days.},

Although governments and conservation groups are promoting small-scale restoration on working farms, there are few studies that assess whether these practices enhance pollinator communities in restored areas. Further, there is no information on whether floral enhancements will deplete pollinators in adjacent fields by concentrating ambient populations or whether they result in a net increase in abundance in adjacent farm fields. We investigated whether field edges restored with native perennial plants in California's Central Valley agricultural region increased floral abundance and potential bee nesting sites, and native bee and syrphid fly abundance and diversity, in comparison to relatively unmanaged edges. Native bees and syrphid flies collected from flowers were more abundant, species-rich, and diverse at hedgerow sites than in weedy, unmanaged edges. Abundance of bees collected passively in pan traps was negatively correlated with floral abundance, was significantly different from communities captured by net sampling from flowers, and did not distinguish between site types; we therefore focused on the results of net samples and visual observations. Uncommon species of native bees were sevenfold more abundant on hedgerow flowers than on flowers at weedy, unmanaged edges. Of the species on flowers at hedgerows, 40\% were exclusive to hedgerow sites, but there were no species exclusively found on flowers at control sites. Hedgerows were especially important for supporting less-common species of native bees in our intensive agricultural landscape. Hedgerows did not concentrate ambient native bee, honey bee, or syphid fly populations, and they acted as net exporters of native bees into adjacent fields. Within-farm habitat restoration such as hedgerow creation may be essential for enhancing native pollinator abundance and diversity, and for pollination services to adjacent crops.},

Serpentine soils, in particular, have three abiotic components thought to confer invasion resistance: a low Ca:Mg ratio, low water-retention capacity, and high concentrations of heavy metals. Consequently, not only do some serpentine-adapted native plants persist only on serpentine soils, but also the community members that depend upon those plants become dependent upon serpentine as well. In an effort to provide additional habitat for the threatened and serpentine-restricted Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis), we experimentally altered a non-serpentine site to mimic the abiotic conditions of serpentine. Attempts to lower the Ca:Mg ratio of soils through the addition of MgSO4 were unsuccessful. We then altered soil depth through the addition of gravel beds to determine the effects of water stress on native and non-native community composition. We found that shallow soils had lower water content and correspondingly had significantly lower non-native species richness and cover. The results present promising means, but also cautionary information, for habitat creation efforts and demonstrate the possible utility of edaphic manipulation in abating non-native plant invasions. None of the experimental plots supported communities capable of sustaining E. editha populations, emphasizing that the manipulation of physical conditions is only likely to be successful in coordination with other restoration techniques.},

	abstract = {Woodland, like many habitats throughout the world, has been severely affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Woodland restoration programmes aimed at reversing habitat loss have been in place in many countries over the last 100 years. In particular, agri-environment schemes (AES) to increase the amount and quality of woodland on agricultural land have operated in Europe and Australia for decades (nearly 30 years in the United Kingdom). However, to date there has been very little assessment of their value to biodiversity. We assessed the potential benefits to biodiversity of woodlands planted during 1988–1991 under a woodland grant scheme (WGS in Scotland), according to local and landscape-level habitat characteristics. Specifically, we (1) performed a linear discriminant analysis to compare the characteristics of 24 WGS sites to those of more mature semi-natural woodlands (34 sites {\textgreater}60 years old), and (2) used existing information on the influence of woodland characteristics on a biologically diverse group (i.e. moths) to quantify the benefits of WGS sites to biodiversity. The creation of new WGS patches increased woodland extent and connectivity in the landscape; however, planting that took place adjacent to previously existing woodland did not usually increase connectivity. WGS sites were mainly composed by broadleaved native tree species, but non-native species were also present. In general, WGS sites had lower tree species richness, proportion of native trees, tree basal area and amount of understory, and higher tree densities and canopy cover than more mature semi-natural woodlands. Overall, WGS sites were predicted to have lower moth abundance and species richness than older semi-natural woodlands. However, the magnitude of these differences depended on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of different moth groups, suggesting that WGS sites are better at providing suitable resources for generalist species and for species less limited by dispersal. Our findings have important implications for the way in which current woodland creation and management schemes operate in many countries and suggest that: (1) the creation of new woodlands should focus on planting native species, (2) woodland creation schemes are likely to be more beneficial for biodiversity if certain management practices (e.g. thinning to enhance structural diversity and accelerate the transition to later successional stages) accompany the provision of these grants, and (3) spatially-targeted woodland creation would further increase the contribution of AES woodlands to enhance biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Why are plant species found in certain locations and not in others? The study of community assembly rules has attempted to answer this question, and many studies articulate the historic dichotomy of deterministic (predictable niches) vs. stochastic (random or semi-random processes). The study of successional sequences to determine whether they converge, as would be expected by deterministic theory, or diverge, as stochastic theory would suggest, has been one method used to investigate this question. In this article we ask the question: Do similar boreal bryophyte communities develop in the similar habitat created by convergent succession after fires of different severities? Or do the stochastic processes generated by fires of different severity lead to different communities? Specifically we predict that deterministic structure will be more important for large forest-floor species than stochastic processes, and that the inverse will be true for small bryophyte species. We used multivariate regression trees and model selection to determine the relative weight of structure (forest structure, substrates, soil structure) and processes (fire severity) for two groups of bryophyte species sampled in 12 sites (seven high-severity and five low-severity fires). Contrary to our first hypothesis, processes were as important for large forest-floor bryophytes as for small pocket species. Fire severity, its interaction with the quality of available habitat, and its impact on the creation of biological legacies played dominant roles in determining community structure. In this study, sites with nearly identical forest structure, generated via convergent succession after high- and low-severity fire, were compared to see whether these sites supported similar bryophyte communities. While similar to some degree, both the large forest-floor species and the pocket species differed after high-severity fire compared to low-severity fire. This result suggests that the "how," or process of habitat generation, influences community composition in this system and that a snapshot of habitat conditions taken at only one point in time is insufficient to explain species distribution.},

	abstract = {Cultivation and cropping are major causes of destruction and degradation of natural ecosystems throughout the world. We face the challenge of maintaining provisioning services while conserving or enhancing other ecosystem services and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. There is a range of possibilities within two types of intervention, namely “land sharing” and “land separation”; the former advocates the enhancement of the farmed environment, but the latter a separation between land designated for farming versus conservation. Land sharing may involve biodiversity-based agricultural practices, learning from traditional farming, changing from conventional to organic agriculture and from “simple” crops and pastures to agro-forestry systems, and restoring or creating specific elements to benefit wildlife and particular services without decreasing agricultural production. Land separation in the farmland context involves restoring or creating non-farmland habitat at the expense of field-level agricultural production—for example, woodland on arable land. Restoration by land sharing has the potential to enhance agricultural production, other ecosystem services and biodiversity at both the field and landscape scale; however, restoration by land separation would provide these benefits only at the landscape scale. Although recent debate has contrasted these approaches, we suggest they should be used in combination to maximize benefits. Furthermore, we suggest “woodland islets”, an intermediate approach between land abandonment and farmland afforestation, for ecological restoration in extensive agricultural landscapes. This approach allows reconciliation of farmland production, conservation of values linked to cultural landscapes, enhancement of biodiversity, and provision of a range of ecosystem services. Beyond academic research, restoration projects within agricultural landscapes are essential if we want to halt environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Across N.W. Europe intensive agricultural management has increased productivity to the detriment of floral resources vital for insect pollinators like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. While the creation of wildflower habitats has been widely used to re-establish such resources into arable ecosystems (e.g. sown into field margins), comparable low cost methods for enhancing floristic diversity in production grasslands are lacking. We investigated how simple and cheep seed mixtures based around three plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs) could be used to enhance flowering resources to benefit insect pollinator communities over a four year period. We demonstrate that the abundance and species richness of pollinators was correlated with the increased availability of legume and non-legume forb flowers. While the flowering resources provided by agricultural cultivars of legumes declined rapidly once sown, the inclusion of a forb component within seed mixtures was effective in increasing the long-term persistence of these resources. As a result the abundance and species richness of insect pollinators over the four years showed greater stability where forbs were also sown. Sward management also played a role in the persistence of floral resources, with grazing more likely to maintain legume cover than cutting. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low cost seed mixtures can be used to enhance floristic diversity to benefit pollinators, although the continued value of these grasslands over time is dependent on complementarity between sown legumes and forbs. As permanent grassland covers c. 40\% of the UK the enhancement of their floristic diversity has a huge potential to benefit insect pollinators. The type of land sharing approaches suggested here maintain modest agricultural productivity and so may be the most likely to achieve benefit to pollinators through wide-scale farmer uptake.},

	abstract = {* A substantial part of the world's land base is dominated by agriculture, and forest habitat often consists of discrete patches of forest and linear woody corridors. These natural components provide habitat for some forest birds, but make conservation of these species difficult. In-field practices applied outside forest patches, such as specific juxtapositions of herbaceous field buffers adjacent to forest habitat, could increase avian diversity contributions of existing forest without creation of additional forest habitat. Our prediction was that herbaceous field buffers would increase bird richness in adjacent forest, and we evaluated four potential mechanisms.


* We used bird count data from a conservation buffer monitoring programme and hierarchical community models to estimate species richness of forest generalist, forest interior and shrubland (edge) species near forest edges with and without adjacent herbaceous field buffers. We accounted for heterogeneity in detection probabilities and forest cover in surrounding landscapes when estimating species- and guild-level responses.


* Consistent with the drift fence hypothesis, adjacent herbaceous buffers were associated with a modest increase in richness of forest interior birds in woody corridors, but not in forest blocks. Consistent with resource complementation, adjacent herbaceous buffers were associated with modest increases in richness of shrubland (edge) birds in both woody corridors and forest blocks.


* Across all species and guilds, adjacent buffers were generally associated with greater abundance (e.g. 28 of 39 species), but these increases were also relatively small and highly variable (i.e. overlapping 95\% credible intervals). Corroborating existing research, effects of adjacent herbaceous buffers are likely real, but neither pervasive nor strong.


* Synthesis and applications. Conservation practices targeted to grassland species often produce measurable conservation benefits for target species. However, biodiversity return for investment would be further increased if targeted practices could be deployed in ways that also produce benefits for non-target species in adjacent habitats. Our results suggest that additional benefits for non-target species using adjacent forest habitat are likely to be modest, so conservation planning should focus on species targeted by the conservation practices and avoidance of potential negative impacts on those species when positive benefits to adjacent habitat are weak or lacking.},

	abstract = {Species introductions have the potential to affect the functionality and stability of ecological communities, but because little is known about how introduced species form novel interactions, these impacts are difficult to predict. We quantified the impacts of species introductions on species interaction networks using five different model scenarios of how a novel species might form plant–pollinator interactions. The network structure was based on experimental manipulations on a community of plants and pollinators and shows that the community was more diverse, ordered, and compartmentalized, but less complex when an invasive plant generalist was present. Our models of species introductions reliably predicted several aspects of novel network structure in the field study. We found that introduced species that become incorporated into the community as generalists (both in the number and frequency of their interactions) have a much larger impact on the structure of plant–pollinator communities than introduced species that integrate into the community with few interactions. Average degree is strongly affected by the number of interactions the novel species forms and whether it competes for interactions, whereas connectance is affected by whether the novel species competes for interactions or adds new interaction partners. The number and size of compartments in the network change only when the novel species adds new interaction partners, while modularity and nestedness respond most to the number of interactions formed by the novel species. We provide a new approach for understanding the impacts of introduced and invasive species on plant–pollinator communities and demonstrate that it is critical to evaluate multiple structural characters simultaneously, as large changes in the fundamental structure of the community may be disguised.},

However, in some countries large areas have been preserved and the demand for meadow recreation by sowing seed mixtures is increasing. In the White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area (Czech Republic) the use of commercial seed mixtures is undesirable and the use of regional mixtures has been investigated. The costs for seeding large areas are high and lower cost techniques are needed. In 1999 a field experiment was set up to investigate the establishment of hay meadow vegetation comparing sowing a regional mixture all over a plot with sowing narrow 2.5 m strips of regional seed mixtures into a matrix of a commercial grass mixture or into natural regeneration. The results after five seasons showed good establishment of the sown species in the meadow treatment. Spread of sown species from the sown strips into the surrounding matrix occurred but the cover of species was lower in the commercial grass matrix compared with the natural regeneration matrix. Colonisation of some plots by unsown desirable grassland species from adjacent grassland habitats also occurred, but more species colonised the natural regeneration matrix than the commercial grasses or the sown meadow matrix itself. Overall, the results indicate that, in appropriate situations, sown strips can provide a lower cost but slower and longer-term alternative to field scale sowing of regional seed mixtures for recreation of hay meadow vegetation.},

	abstract = {Organic farmers cannot use most commonly available synthetic insecticides to control crop pests and reduce economic losses due to pest outbreaks. Instead, they rely heavily on the activities of naturally occurring predators and parasitoids, particularly in broad-acre crops such as cereals. It is still unclear whether organic farms which typically support greater levels of biodiversity also experience greater levels of pest control services. We assess whether organic farming systems were better able to control cereal aphids due to a greater diversity and activity of naturally occurring parasitoid species. We anticipated greater parasitism rate of aphids in organic arable fields due to closer proximity to plants that provide resources for adult parasitoids and places that are suitable for overwintering, and the presence of alternate aphid hosts when cereals are absent. Aphids were collected from organic and conventional cereal crops, and screened for parasitoid DNA using diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Aphid abundance was low across the season, however organic cereal fields had significantly greater aphid abundance. From the 1446 aphids screened we detected 12 parasitoid taxa. There was no difference in parasitism rate between the farming systems (org. mean mortality 20.9 ± 3.3\% s.e., con. 29.8 ± 4.9\%). Furthermore, there was no difference between farming systems in hyperparasitoid attack and multiparasitism rates, parasitoid richness and parasitoid community diversity. The most abundant species recorded on organic and conventional farms was the generalist aphid primary parasitoid Ephedrus plagiator. It appears that the extra plant diversity and greater area of semi-natural habitats on organic farms offer no advantage for increasing cereal aphid parasitoid diversity, at least at the aphid abundances encountered during the sampling period.},

Most of the final questions were derived through a process of modification and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided into 12 sections: ecosystem functions and services, climate change, technological change, protected areas, ecosystem management and restoration, terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, species management, organizational systems and processes, societal context and change, and impacts of conservation interventions.

	abstract = {A frequent observation in plant–animal mutualistic networks is that abundant species tend to be more generalised, interacting with a broader range of interaction partners than rare species. Uncovering the causal relationship between abundance and generalisation has been hindered by a chicken-and-egg dilemma: is generalisation a by-product of being abundant, or does high abundance result from generalisation? Here, we analyse a database of plant–pollinator and plant–seed disperser networks, and provide strong evidence that the causal link between abundance and generalisation is uni-directional. Specifically, species appear to be generalists because they are more abundant, but the converse, that is that species become more abundant because they are generalists, is not supported by our analysis. Furthermore, null model analyses suggest that abundant species interact with many other species simply because they are more likely to encounter potential interaction partners.},

	abstract = {Dispersal syndromes and networks must be used cautiously in conserving and restoring seed-dispersal processes. In many tropical forests most tree and shrub species require dispersal by animals for local persistence and for migration in response to environmental change. The most important errors to avoid in practical use of both dispersal syndromes (suites of fruit and seed characteristics that attract different dispersal agents) and network modules (groups of interacting dispersal agents and plants bearing fruits or seeds that they eat) are: (1) assuming that use of fruit resources by fruit-eating animals implies effective seed dispersal; (2) assuming that superficially similar fruits imply equally effective dispersal by similar animals, and (3) assuming that fruit resources at issue support animal populations. This essay explores strengths and weaknesses of uses of dispersal syndromes and disperser networks modules in conservation and restoration. Examples include some that are consistent with expectations from syndrome categorization and some that are not. An unappreciated weakness in using either dispersal syndromes or network modules is that contingent foraging by animals in highly disturbed habitats, now comprising 60\%–70\% of tropical land biomes, may not resemble foraging choices or consequences in protected closed forests, where most research on tropical seed dispersal is done. General prescriptions for the future include maintaining or creating habitat heterogeneity in largely deforested landscapes where remnant closed forests still exist, and active restoration in landscapes where little heterogeneity remains. In both cases, adaptations of multiple frame-work tree approaches have the best chance of preserving or enhancing populations of animal-dispersed trees and their seed vectors, and in opening migration paths in response to climate change.},

Traditionally, nestedness has been treated in a binary sense: species and their interactions are either present or absent, neglecting information on abundances and interaction frequencies. Extending nestedness to quantitative data facilitates the study of species preferences, and we propose a new detection method that follows from a basic property of bipartite networks: large dominant eigenvalues are associated with highly nested configurations. We show that complex ecological networks are binary nested, but quantitative preferences are non-nested, indicating limited consumer overlap of favoured resources. The spectral graph approach provides a formal link to local dynamical stability analysis, where we demonstrate that nested mutualistic structures are minimally stable. We conclude that, within the binary constraint of interaction plausibility, species preferences are partitioned to avoid competition, thereby benefiting system-wide resource allocation.},

Conservation efforts, however, have not been designed specifically to protect these organisms, despite their ecological and evolutionary significance. On the basis of species–host area equations, parameterized with data from the literature and interviews with botanical experts, I estimated the number of specialized plant-feeding insects (i.e., monophages) that live in 34 biodiversity hotspots and the number committed to extinction because of habitat loss. I estimated that 795,971–1,602,423 monophagous insect species live in biodiversity hotspots on 150,371 endemic plant species, which is 5.3–10.6 monophages per plant species. I calculated that 213,830–547,500 monophagous species are committed to extinction in biodiversity hotspots because of reduction of the geographic range size of their endemic hosts. I provided rankings of biodiversity hotspots on the basis of estimated richness of monophagous insects and on estimated number of extinctions of monophagous species. Extinction rates were predicted to be higher in biodiversity hotspots located along strong environmental gradients and on archipelagos, where high spatial turnover of monophagous species along the geographic distribution of their endemic plants is likely. The results strongly support the overall strategy of selecting priority conservation areas worldwide primarily on the basis of richness of endemic plants. To face the global decline of insect herbivores, one must expand the coverage of the network of protected areas and improve the richness of native plants on private lands.},

	abstract = {Species coexistence within ecosystems and the stability of patterns of temporal changes in population sizes are central topics in ecological theory. In the last decade, adaptive behaviour has been proposed as a mechanism of population stabilization. In particular, widely distributed adaptive trophic behaviour (ATB), the fitness-enhancing changes in individuals’ feeding-related traits due to variation in their trophic environment, may play a key role in modulating the dynamics of feeding relationships within natural communities. In this article, we review and synthesize models and results from theoretical research dealing with the consequences of ATB on the structure and dynamics of complex food webs. We discuss current approaches, point out limitations, and consider questions ripe for future research. In spite of some differences in the modelling and analytic approaches, there are points of convergence: (1) ATB promotes the complex structure of ecological networks, (2) ATB increases the stability of their dynamics, (3) ATB reverses May’s negative complexity–stability relationship, and (4) ATB provides resilience and resistance of networks against perturbations. Current knowledge supports ATB as an essential ingredient for models of community dynamics, and future research that incorporates ATB will be well positioned to address questions important for basic ecological research and its applications.},

The aim of this study was to determine the ecological traits that best predict extinction risk and distribution change in Finnish geometrid moths and to develop an understanding of the biological connections between these traits and threats. We found that larval specificity, overwintering stage and flight period length predicted distribution change and extinction risk. There was also an interaction effect between larval specificity and body size on both distribution change and extinction risk. In monophagous species the host plant distribution predicted extinction risk. Even though ecological traits are known to be important determinants of extinction risk, the IUCN red list categorization system is exclusively based on quantitative measures of populations and ignores the ecological traits. Here, we propose that taxon specific ecological data should also be used to predict extinction risk at least on a regional scale to improve the accuracy of the IUCN extinction risk classification.},

We identify functional groups using multivariate analysis of plant traits which influence ecosystem processes. Functional redundancy is calculated as the species richness within each group, and response diversity as the multivariate within-group dispersion in response trait space, using traits that influence responses to disturbances. Meta-analysis across all datasets showed that land-use intensification significantly reduced both functional redundancy and response diversity, although specific relationships varied considerably among the different land-use gradients.

The scientific discipline of restoration ecology provides conceptual guidance and tests of restoration strategies, with the ultimate goal of predictive landscape restoration. I construct a conceptual model for restoration of biodiversity, based on site-level (e.g., biotic and abiotic) conditions, landscape (e.g, interpatch connectivity and patch geometry), and historical factors (e.g., species arrival order and land-use legacies). I then ask how well restoration ecology has addressed the various components of this model. During the past decade, restoration research has focused largely on how the restoration of site-level factors promotes species diversity—primarily of plants. Relatively little attention has been paid to how landscape or historical factors interplay with restoration, how restoration influences functional and genetic components of biodiversity, or how a suite of less-studied taxa might be restored. I suggest that the high level of variation seen in restoration outcomes might be explained, at least in part, by the contingencies placed on site-level restoration by landscape and historical factors and then present a number of avenues for future research to address these often ignored linkages in the biodiversity restoration model. Such work will require carefully conducted restoration experiments set across multiple sites and many years. It is my hope that by considering how space and time influence restoration, we might move restoration ecology in a direction of stronger prediction, conducted across landscapes, thus providing feasible restoration strategies that work at scales over which biodiversity conservation occurs.},

The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence–absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the “FD” R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

Conserving biodiversity is a daunting task, and the paper asserts that focusing on species is not the best approach. The best way to minimize species loss is to maintain the integrity of ecosystem function. The important questions therefore concern the kinds of biodiversity that are significant to ecosystem functioning. To best focus our efforts we need to establish how much (or how little) redundancy there is in the biological composition of ecosystems. An approach is suggested, based on the use of functional groups of organisms defined according to ecosystem processes. Functional groups with little or no redundancy warrant priority conservation effort. Complementary species-based approaches for maximizing the inclusion of biodiversity within a set of conservation areas are compared to the functional-group approach.},

The key life-history traits are brood size, size of young, the age distribution of reproductive effort, the interaction of reproductive effort with adutl mortality, and the variation in these traits among an individual's progeny. The general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations of traits will evolve in organisms living in specified circumstances. First consider single traits. Theorists have made the following predictions: (1) Where adult exceeds juvenile mortality, the organism should reproduce only once in its lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality, the organism should reproduce several times. (2) Brood size should maximize the number of young surviving to maturity, summed over the lifetime of the parent. But when optimum brood-size varies unpredictably in time, smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the chances of total failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding populations, selection should minimize age at maturity. In stable populations, when reproductive success depends on size, age, or social status, or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then maturation should be delayed, as it should be in declining populations. (4) Young should increase in size at birth with increased predation risk, and decrease in size with increased resource availability. Theorists have also predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur in specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations, age at maturity should be minimized, reproductive effort concentrated early in life, and brood size increased. (6) One view holds that in stable environments, late maturity, multiple broods, a few, large young, parental care, and small reproductive efforts should be favored (K-selection). In fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small young, reduced parental care, and large reproductive efforts should be favored (r-selection). (7) But another view holds that when juvenile mortality fluctuates more than adult mortality, the traits associated with stable and fluctuating environments should be reversed. We need experiments that test the assumptions and predictions reviewed here, more comprehensive theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions, and examination of different definitions of fitness.},

Restoration ecology and conservation biology share many underlying biodiversity goals, but differ in striking ways. Using data from published literature in these two fields, I document that conservation biology has been more zoological, more descriptive and theoretical, and more focused on population and genetic studies than restoration ecology, which has been more botanical, more experimental, and more focused on population, community and ecosystem studies. I also use documented trends in population, land use, and biodiversity awareness to suggest that in the future ecological restoration will play an increasing role in biodiversity conservation. The conservation mind set is one of loss on a relatively short time horizon, whereas the restoration mind set is one of long-term recovery. I suggest that a restoration mind set can provide useful insights into problems of conservation today, illustrated with examples examining edge effects and integrated conservation and development projects.},

A genotype moulds its phenotype’s age patterns of mortality and fertility in an environment; these two patterns in turn determine the genotype’s fitness in that environment. Hence, to understand the evolution of ageing, age patterns of mortality and reproduction need to be compared for species across the tree of life. However, few studies have done so and only for a limited range of taxa. Here we contrast standardized patterns over age for 11 mammals, 12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 vascular plants and a green alga. Although it has been predicted that evolution should inevitably lead to increasing mortality and declining fertility with age after maturity, there is great variation among these species, including increasing, constant, decreasing, humped and bowed trajectories for both long- and short-lived species. This diversity challenges theoreticians to develop broader perspectives on the evolution of ageing and empiricists to study the demography of more species.},

* Here, we use a plant–hummingbird network with unprecedented sampling effort (2716 h of focal observations) from the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, to investigate how sampling effort affects the description of network structure (i.e. widely used network metrics) and the relative importance of distinct processes (i.e. species abundances vs. traits) in determining the frequency of pairwise interactions.


* By dividing the network into time slices representing a gradient of sampling effort, we show that quantitative metrics, such as interaction evenness, specialization (H2′), weighted nestedness (wNODF) and modularity (Q; QuanBiMo algorithm) were less biased by sampling incompleteness than binary metrics. Furthermore, the significance of some network metrics changed along the sampling effort gradient. Nevertheless, the higher importance of traits in structuring the network was apparent even with small sampling effort.


* Our results (i) warn against using very poorly sampled networks as this may bias our understanding of networks, both their patterns and structuring processes, (ii) encourage the use of quantitative metrics little influenced by sampling when performing spatio-temporal comparisons and (iii) indicate that in networks strongly constrained by species traits, such as plant–hummingbird networks, even small sampling is sufficient to detect their relative importance for the frequencies of interactions. Finally, we argue that similar effects of sampling are expected for other highly specialized subnetworks.},

However, the stability of ecological networks may be more dependent on the way different interaction types are combined in real communities. To address this issue, we start by compiling an ecological network in the Doñana Biological Reserve, southern Spain, with 390 species and 798 mu-tualistic and antagonistic interactions. We characterize network structure by looking at how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are combined across all plant species. Both the ratio of mutualistic to antagonistic interactions per plant, and the number of basic modules with an antagonistic and a mutualistic interaction are very heterogeneous across plant species, with a few plant species showing very high values for these parameters. To assess the implications of these network patterns on species diversity, we study analytically and by simulation a model of this ecological network. We find that the observed correlation between strong interaction strengths and high mutualistic to antagonistic ratios in a few plant species significantly increases community diversity. Thus, to predict the persistence of biodiversity we need to understand how interaction strength and the architecture of ecological networks with different interaction types are combined.},

Robustness from the perspective of secondary extinctions has been addressed in the context of food webs to consider the complex network of species interactions that underlie responses to perturbations. In-silico removal experiments have examined the structural properties of food webs that enhance or hamper the robustness of ecosystems to species losses, with a focus on the role of hubs, the most connected species. Here we take a different approach and focus on the role of the connections themselves. We show that trophic links can be divided into functional and redundant based on their contribution to robustness. The analysis of empirical webs shows that hubs are not necessarily the most important species as they may hold many redundant links. Furthermore, the fraction of functional connections is high and constant across systems regardless of size and interconnectedness. The main consequence of this scaling pattern is that ecosystem robustness can be considerably reduced by species extinctions even when these do not result in any secondary extinctions. This introduces the possibility of tipping points in the collapse of ecosystems.},

One of the key aspects of food web structure is complexity, or connectance, the number of links expressed as a proportion of the total possible number of links. Connectance (complexity) is linked to the stability of webs and is a key parameter in recent models of other aspects of web structure. However, there is still no fundamental biological explanation for connectance in food webs. Here, we propose that constraints on diet breadth, driven by optimal foraging, provide such an explanation. We show that a simple diet breadth model predicts highly constrained values of connectance as an emergent consequence of individual foraging behavior. When combined with features of real food web data, such as taxonomic and trophic aggregation and cumulative sampling of diets, the model predicts well the levels of connectance and scaling of connectance with species richness, seen in real food webs. This result is a previously undescribed synthesis of foraging theory and food web theory, in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.},

We also studied whether total interaction frequency is partitioned more evenly among individual links in richer webs. Our results reveal a direct effect of area on the number of links and species present in each pollination web. However, link richness increased twofold faster than species richness with area. These area effects were not confounded by sampling effort or correlated incidence of exotic species, despite widespread habitat disturbance. Habitat proximity, an inverse measure of isolation, had a marginally significant influence on link but not on species richness. Increased link number was associated with decreasing dominance by any particular interaction and increasing interaction evenness. Despite the strong area effect, a rich pollination web sampled from a small, protected sierra suggests that simple conservation measures, such as reduced grazing and fire suppression, may effectively preserve much local interaction diversity.},

We propose a conceptual scheme for studying the strength of plant–animal mutualistic interactions. We first review the interaction strength concepts developed for food webs, and explore how these concepts have been applied to mutualistic interactions. We then outline and explain a conceptual framework for defining ecological effects in plant–animal mutualisms. We give recommendations for measuring interaction strength from data collected in field studies based on a proposed approach for the assessment of interaction strength in plant–animal mutualisms. This approach is conceptually integrative and methodologically feasible, as it focuses on two key variables usually measured in field studies: the frequency of interactions and the fitness components influenced by the interactions.},

	abstract = {In the last 15 years, a complex networks perspective has been increasingly used in the robustness assessment of ecological systems. It is therefore crucial to assess the reliability of such tools. Based on the traditional simulation of node (species) removal, mutualistic pollination networks are considered to be relatively robust because of their 1) truncated power-law degree distribution, 2) redundancy in the number of pollinators per plant and 3) nested interaction pattern. However, species removal is only one of several possible approaches to network robustness assessment. Empirical evidence suggests a decline in abundance prior to the extinction of interacting species, arguing in favour of an interaction removal-based approach (i.e. interaction disruption), as opposed to traditional species removal. For simulated networks, these two approaches yield radically different conclusions, but no tests are currently available for empirical mutualistic networks. This study compared this new robustness evaluation approach based on interaction extinction versus the traditional species removal approach for 12 alpine and subalpine pollination networks. In comparison with species removal, interaction removal produced higher robustness in the worst-case extinction scenario but lower robustness in the best-case extinction scenario. Our results indicate that: 1) these two approaches yield very different conclusions and 2) existing assessments of ecological network robustness could be overly optimistic, at least those based on a disturbance affecting species at random or beginning with the least connected species. Therefore, further empirical study of plant–pollinator interactions in disturbed ecosystems is imperative to understand how pollination networks are disassembled.},

Specialized interactors, including ‘cryptic specialists’ with diverse but nonredundant partner assemblages, incur elevated risk. Risk is also higher for species that cannot either evolve new traits following partner loss or obtain novel partners in communities reorganizing under changing environmental conditions. Partner loss occurs alongside other anthropogenic impacts; multiple stressors can circumvent ecological buffers, enhancing secondary extinction risk. Stressors can also offset each other, reducing secondary extinction risk, a hitherto unappreciated phenomenon. This synthesis suggests improved conservation planning tactics and critical directions for research on secondary extinctions.},

* The most informative form of networks are quantitative or weighted networks. Here, we introduce an algorithm to identify modules in quantitative bipartite (or two-mode) networks. It is based on the hierarchical random graphs concept of Clauset et al. (2008 Nature 453: 98–101) and is extended to include quantitative information and adapted to work with bipartite graphs. We define the algorithm, which we call QuanBiMo, sketch its performance on simulated data and illustrate its potential usefulness with a case study.


* Modules are detected with a higher accuracy in simulated quantitative networks than in their binary counterparts. Even at high levels of noise, QuanBiMo still classifies 70\% of links correctly as within- or between-modules. Recursively applying the algorithm results in additional information of within-module organization of the network.


* The algorithm introduced here must be seen as a considerable improvement over the current standard of algorithms for binary networks. Due to its higher sensitivity, it is likely to lead to be useful for detecting modules in the typically noisy data of ecological networks.},

	abstract = {Summary
The pressing need to conserve and restore habitats in the face of ongoing species loss [1, 2] requires a better understanding of what happens to communities when species are lost or reinstated [3, 4]. Theoretical models show that communities are relatively insensitive to species loss [5, 6]; however, they disagree with field manipulations showing a cascade of extinctions [7, 8] and have seldom been tested under field conditions (e.g., [9]). We experimentally removed the most abundant seed-dispersing ant species from seed dispersal networks in a Mediterranean landscape, replicating the experiment in three types of habitat, and then compared these communities to un-manipulated control communities. Removal did not result in large-scale changes in network structure. It revealed extensive structural plasticity of the remaining community, which rearranged itself through rewiring, while maintaining its functionality. The remaining ant species widened their diet breadth in a way that maintained seed dispersal, despite the identity of many interactions changing. The species interaction strength decreased; thus, the importance of each ant species for seed dispersal became more homogeneous, thereby reducing the dependence of seed species on one dominant ant species. Compared to the experimental results, a simulation model that included rewiring considerably overestimated the effect of species loss on network robustness. If community-level species loss models are to be of practical use in ecology or conservation, they need to include behavioral and population responses, and they need to be routinely tested under field conditions; doing this would be to the advantage of both empiricists and theoreticians.},

While a significant amount is known about the types of communities and species that suffer secondary extinctions, little is known about the consequences of secondary extinctions for biodiversity. Here we examine the effect of these secondary extinctions on trophic diversity, the range of trophic roles played by the species in a community. Our analyses of natural and model food webs show that secondary extinctions cause loss of trophic diversity greater than that expected from chance, a result that is robust to variation in food web structure, distribution of interactions strengths, functional response, and adaptive foraging. Greater than expected loss of trophic diversity occurs because more trophically unique species are more vulnerable to secondary extinction. This is not a straightforward consequence of these species having few links with others but is a complex function of how direct and indirect interactions affect species persistence. A positive correlation between a species’ extinction probability and the importance of its loss defines high‐risk species and should make their conservation a priority.},

	abstract = {Summary
Species extinction rates due to human activities are high [1–3], and initial extinctions can trigger cascades of secondary extinctions, leading to further erosion of biodiversity [4]. A potential major mechanism for secondary extinction cascades is provided by the long-standing theory that the diversity of consumer species is maintained due to the positive indirect effects that these species have on each other by reducing competition among their respective resource species [5–7]. This means that the loss of one carnivore species could lead to competitive exclusion at the prey trophic level, leading to extinctions of further carnivore species. Evidence for these effects is difficult to obtain due to many confounding factors in natural systems, but extinction cascades that could be due to this mechanism have been demonstrated in simplified laboratory microcosms [8]. We established complex insect food webs in replicated field mesocosms and found that the overharvesting of one parasitoid wasp species caused increased extinction rates of other parasitoid species, compared to controls, but only when we manipulated the spatial distribution of herbivore species such that the potential for interspecific competition at this level was high. This provides clear evidence for horizontal extinction cascades at high trophic levels due to the proposed mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the loss of carnivores can have widespread effects on other species at the same trophic level due to indirect population-dynamic effects that are rarely considered in this context.},

Seed production per flower on the mainland is reduced 84\%. Mainland sites have similar adult densities, but 55\% fewer juvenile plants per adult, than island sites. Seed addition experiments near adult R. solandri plants on the mainland found strong seed limitation 5 years after sowing for R. solandri but not for two other co-occurring woody species.

	abstract = {Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65\% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic communities have an internal structure that makes them resilient to external perturbations. Late research has focused on their stability and the topology of the relations between the different organisms to explain the reasons of the system robustness. Much less attention has been invested in analyzing the systems dynamics. The main population models in use are modifications of the r − K formulation of logistic equation with additional terms to account for the benefits produced by the interspecific interactions. These models have shortcomings as the so-called r − K formulation diverges under some conditions. In this work, we introduce a model for population dynamics under mutualism that preserves the original logistic formulation. It is mathematically simpler than the widely used type II models, although it shows similar complexity in terms of fixed points and stability of the dynamics. We perform an analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations to study the model behavior in general interaction scenarios including tests of the resilience of its dynamics under external perturbations. Despite its simplicity, our results indicate that the model dynamics shows an important richness that can be used to gain further insights in the dynamics of mutualistic communities.},

	doi = {10.2307/2937163},
	abstract = {The usefulness and generality of the keystone species concept has recently been questioned. We investigated variation in interaction strength between the original keystone predator, the seastar Pisaster ochraceus, and its primary prey, mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus). The study was prompted by differences in community structure at two low zone sites along the central Oregon coast, Boiler Bay (BB) and Strawberry Hill (SH). Predators, especially seastars, were larger and more abundant at SH than at BB. Further, sessile animals were more abundant and macrophytes were less abundant at SH. Predators were more abundant at wave-exposed sites at both sites, and at SH, sessile invertebrates were more abundant at the wave-exposed location and sand cover was high at the wave-protected location. To test the hypothesis that variation in predation strength explained some of these differences, we examined the seastar-mussel interaction at locations with high and low wave exposure at both sites. Predation intensity was quantified by determining the survival of mussels in clumps (50 mussels per clump, shell length 4-7 cm) transplanted to large plots (18-163 m{\textasciicircum}2) with or without seastars in the low intertidal zone. Predation effects were quantified by determining prey recolonization rates in marked quadrats in the same large plots. Spatial variation in interaction strength was quantified by examining predation at scales of metres (among transplants within plots), 10's of metres (between replicate plots within each exposure at each site), 100's of metres (between wave exposures within locations), and 10 000's of metres (between sites). Temporal variation was evaluated by performing the experiments in 1990 and 1991. The relation between prey (mussel) recruitment and growth to differences in community structure was evaluated by quantifying recruitment density in plastic mesh balls (collectors) and growth of individually marked transplanted mussels, respectively, at each site @? exposure @? tide level combination each month for 4 yr. Predation intensity varied greatly at all spatial scales. At the two largest spatial scales (10's of kilometres, 100's of metres), differences in both survival of transplanted mussels and prey recolonization depended on variation in seastar abundance with site, wave exposure, prey recruitment and growth, and at SH protected, the extent of sand burial. Variation at the two smallest scales (metres, 10's of metres) was high when seastars were scarce and low when seastars were abundant. Transplanted mussels suffered 100\% mortality in 2 wk at wave-exposed SH, but took {\textgreater}52 wk at wave-protected BB. Seastar effects on prey recolonization were detected only at the SH wave-exposed site. Here, where prey recruitment and growth were unusually high, the mussel M. trossulus invaded and dominated space within 9 mo. After 14 mo, whelks, which increased in both size and abundance in the absence of Pisaster, arrested this increase in mussel abundance. Similar changes did not occur at other site @? exposure combinations, evidently because prey recruitment was low and possibly also due to whelk predation on juveniles. Longer term results indicate that, as in Washington state, seastars prevent large adult M. californianus from invading lower intertidal regions, but only at wave-exposed, not wave-protected sites. Thus, three distinct predation regimes were observed: (1) strong keystone predation by seastars at wave-exposed headlands; (2) less-strong diffuse predation by seastars, whelks, and possibly other predators at a wave-protected cove, and (3) weak predation at a wave-protected site buried regularly by sand. Comparable experimental results at four wave-exposed headlands (our two in Oregon and two others in Washington), and similarities between these and communities on other West Coast headlands suggest keystone predation occurs broadly in this system. Results in wave-protected habitats, however, suggest it is not universal. In Oregon, keystone predation was evidently contingent on conditions of high prey production (i.e., recruitment and growth), while diffuse predation occurred when prey production was low, and weak predation occurred when environmental stress was high. Combining our results with examples from other marine and non-marine habitats suggests a need to consider a broader range of models than just keystone predation. The predictive and explanatory value of an expanded set of models depends on identifying factors distinguishing them. Although evidence is limited, a survey of 17 examples suggests (1) keystone predation is evidently not distinguished from diffuse predation by any of 11 previously proposed differences, but (2) may be distinguished by rates of prey production. Further, (3) differential predation on competitively dominant prey does not distinguish keystone from nonkeystone systems, since this interaction occurs in both types of community. Instead, differential predation on dominant prey evidently distinguishes strong-from weak-predation communities. While the keystone predation concept has been and will continue to be useful, a broadened focus on testing and developing more general models of community regulation is needed.},

Interaction networks provide a framework that has proven useful in ecological research. However, they are considered time consuming and too expensive for conservation purposes. We investigate whether it is possible to sample interaction networks cost-efficiently and whether a compromise exists between data quality and amount of resources required to sample the data by using a highly resolved mutualistic plant–pollinator network sampled over two years in Norway. The dataset was resampled with decreasing sampling intensity to simulate decreasing monitoring costs and we investigated the cost-efficiency of these monitoring regimes. The success in monitoring community structure varied largely with sampling intensity and the descriptor investigated. One major result was that a large proportion of the functionally most important species in the community, both plants and insects, could be identified with relatively little sampling. For example, monitoring only in “peak-season”, which costs ca. 20\% relative to full monitoring, resulted in recording of 70\% (in 2003) or 85\% (in 2004) of the top 20 most functionally important pollinator species. Also, peak-season monitoring resulted in relatively precise estimates of several network descriptors. We present a first estimation of the full cost (travel time, sampling time and taxonomic services) of constructing pollination networks with different sampling effort. We recommend monitoring plant–pollinator networks in temperate regions during peak-season to cost-efficiently collect data for practical habitat management of ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {People depend on benefits provided by ecological systems. Understanding how these ecosystem services – and the ecosystem properties underpinning them – respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species’ effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms – which both depend on combinations of functional traits – correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species’ phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.},

Despite this ecosystem service value, adoption of field border plantings, such as hedgerows, on large-scale mono-cropped farms is minimal. With profits primarily driving agricultural production, a major challenge affecting hedgerow plantings is linked to establishment costs and the lack of clear economic benefits on the restoration investment. Our study documented that hedgerows are economically viable to growers by enhancing beneficial insects and natural pest control and pollination on farms. With pest control alone, our model shows that it would take 16 yr to break even from insecticide savings on the US\$4,000 cost of a typical 300-m hedgerow field edge planting. By adding in pollination benefits by native bees, where honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) may be limiting, the return time is reduced to 7 yr. USDA cost share programs allow for a quicker return on a hedgerow investment. Our study shows that over time, small-scale restoration can be profitable, helping to overcome the barrier of cost associated with field edge habitat restoration on farms.},

To identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled, dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on species’ connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further, to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models. This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover, there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low trophic levels. In contrast to previous studies we can infer, albeit indirectly, that secondary extinctions were triggered by both bottom-up and top-down cascades.},

Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field.

The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits.

The effects of mutualisms pervade multiple levels of biological organisation. At the individual level, mutualisms provide fitness benefits for interacting partners, creating novel metabolic pathways and providing dispersal services, trophic rewards or defence against natural enemies. At the population level, the positive effects of mutualisms have the potential to increase population densities above the limits imposed by resource availability. At the community level, mutualisms form networks of interacting species that impact the persistence of local populations as well as their evolutionary and ecological dynamics. The broader implications of mutualisms to biodiversity are illustrated by the fact that mutualistic interactions are the backbone of species-rich ecological communities, such as tropical rainforests and coral reefs, and by how mutualisms fueled the spreading of humankind around the world.

Key Concepts




* Mutualisms are ecological interactions among individuals of different species that result in positive net benefits for both sides.

* Individuals of most species are involved in mutualistic interactions.

* The natural history of mutualisms is highly diverse, ranging from short-term associations among partners to interactions in which individuals are biologically attached for most of their lives.

* Some mutualisms are symbiotic, that is, individuals show tight biological integration, but symbiosis and mutualisms are not synonyms.

* All animals, plants and fungi are built on mutualisms between eukaryote cells and intracellular symbionts that have became organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.

* Mutualisms have the potential to create positive feedbacks leading to large population densities, but these effects are offset by other ecological interactions, such as competition and predation, and also by the costs of mutualisms.

* Reciprocal specialisation is rare in species-rich mutualisms.

* At the community level, mutualisms form multispecies ecological networks that show recurrent structural patterns.

* A variety of structural patterns observed in mutualistic networks have disparate effects on system dynamics, which can affect the long-term persistence of species and communities.

* The most diverse ecosystems on Earth are shaped by mutualistic interactions.},

	abstract = {Human land use tends to decrease the diversity of native plant species and facilitate the invasion and establishment of exotic ones. Such changes in land use and plant community composition usually have negative impacts on the assemblages of native herbivorous insects. Highly specialized herbivores are expected to be especially sensitive to land use intensification and the presence of exotic plant species because they are neither capable of consuming alternative plant species of the native flora nor exotic plant species. Therefore, higher levels of land use intensity might reduce the proportion of highly specialized herbivores, which ultimately would lead to changes in the specialization of interactions in plant-herbivore networks. This study investigates the community-wide effects of land use intensity on the degree of specialization of 72 plant-herbivore networks, including effects mediated by the increase in the proportion of exotic plant species. Contrary to our expectation, the net effect of land use intensity on network specialization was positive. However, this positive effect of land use intensity was partially canceled by an opposite effect of the proportion of exotic plant species on network specialization. When we analyzed networks composed exclusively of endophagous herbivores separately from those composed exclusively of exophagous herbivores, we found that only endophages showed a consistent change in network specialization at higher land use levels. Altogether, these results indicate that land use intensity is an important ecological driver of network specialization, by way of reducing the local host range of herbivore guilds with highly specialized feeding habits. However, because the effect of land use intensity is offset by an opposite effect owing to the proportion of exotic host species, the net effect of land use in a given herbivore assemblage will likely depend on the extent of the replacement of native host species with exotic ones.},

	abstract = {Aim

Alien species alter interaction networks by disrupting existing interactions, for example between plants and pollinators, and by engaging in new interactions. Predicting the effects of an incoming invader can be difficult, although recent work suggests species roles in interaction networks may be conserved across locations. We test whether species roles in plant–pollinator networks differ between their native and alien ranges and whether the former can be used to predict the latter.


Location

World-wide.


Methods

We used 64 plant–pollinator networks to search for species occurring in at least one network in its native range and one network in its alien range. We found 17 species meeting these criteria, distributed in 48 plant–pollinator networks. We characterized each species’ role by estimating species-level network indices: normalized degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and two measures of contribution to modularity (c- and z-scores). Linear mixed models and linear regression models were used to test for differences in species role between native and alien ranges and to predict those roles from the native to the alien range, respectively.


Results

Species roles varied considerably across species. Nevertheless, although species lost their native mutualists and gained novel interactions in the alien community, their role did not differ significantly between ranges. Consequently, closeness centrality and normalized degree in the alien range were highly predictable from the native range networks.


Main conclusions

Species with high degree and centrality define the core of nested networks. Our results suggest that core species are likely to establish interactions and be core species in the alien range, whilst species with few interactions in their native range will behave similarly in their alien range. Our results provide new insights into species role conservatism and could help ecologists to predict alien species impact at the community level.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities. Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture independent of species composition and latitude; specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species. Despite sustained efforts to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus. Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community. Our work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks.},

Although they have had a controversial history, null models are widely used as statistical tools by ecologists and biogeographers. Three active research fronts in null model analysis include biodiversity measures, species co-occurrence patterns, and macroecology. In the analysis of biodiversity, ecologists have used random sampling procedures such as rarefaction to adjust for differences in abundance and sampling effort. In the analysis of species co-occurrence and assembly rules, null models have been used to detect the signature of species interactions. However, controversy persists over the details of computer algorithms used for randomizing presence–absence matrices. Finally, in the newly emerging discipline of macroecology, null models can be used to identify constraining boundaries in bivariate scatterplots of variables such as body size, range size, and population density. Null models provide specificity and flexibility in data analysis that is often not possible with conventional statistical tests.},

We compared the performance of a suite of null models and metrics that have been proposed to measure patterns of segregation, aggregation, nestedness, coherence, and species turnover. We found that any matrix with segregated species pairs can be re-ordered to highlight aggregated pairs, indicating that these seemingly opposite patterns are closely related. Recently proposed classification schemes failed to correctly classify realistic matrices that included multiple co-occurrence structures. We propose using a combination of metrics and decomposing matrix-wide patterns into those of individual pairs of species and sites to pinpoint sources of non-randomness. Null model analysis has been a popular tool for detecting pattern in binary presence–absence matrices, and previous tests have identified algorithms and metrics that have good statistical properties. However, the behavior of different metrics is often correlated, making it difficult to distinguish different patterns. We compared the performance of a suite of null models and metrics that have been proposed to measure patterns of segregation, aggregation, nestedness, coherence, and species turnover. We found that any matrix with segregated species pairs can be re-ordered to highlight aggregated pairs. As a consequence, the same null model can identify a single matrix as being simultaneously aggregated, segregated or nested. These results cast doubt on previous conclusions of matrix-wide species segregation based on the C-score and the fixed-fixed algorithm. Similarly, we found that recently proposed classification schemes based on patterns of coherence, nestedness, and segregation and aggregation cannot be uniquely distinguished using proposed metrics and null model algorithms. It may be necessary to use a combination of different metrics and to decompose matrix-wide patterns into those of individual pairs of species or pairs of sites to pinpoint the sources of non-randomness.},

Statistical inference of matrix structure often used a fixed–fixed (FF) null model in which matrix entries are randomized, but the row and column total of each random matrix match those of the original matrix. However, in a stochastically assembled meta-community, row and column totals of a random assemblage might be expected to vary among matrices. Here we introduce a 4-step proportional–proportional (PP) algorithm that creates null matrices in which the row and column vary randomly, but the average row and column totals in a set of PP matrices are unbiased and match those of the original matrix. We tested the performance of the PP algorithm with 5 sets of artificial matrices and one large set of 288 published empirical matrices. Compared to the FF algorithm, the PP algorithm has better power to detect segregated and nested matrices, but it is vulnerable to Type I errors if row and column sums have small variances. The PP algorithm identified only 9\% of empirical matrices as significantly segregated, compared with 30\% identified by the traditional FF algorithm. The choice between whether to use the PP or the FF algorithm is similar to the distinction between random and fixed effects in a mixed-model ANOVA. For robust analysis, it may be desirable to use both the PP and the FF algorithms with the same data matrix.},

We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.},

This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested.

High levels of tropical (low-latitude) plant and insect diversity relative to poleward latitudes and the disproportionate abundance of host-specialized insect herbivores have been noted. This review addresses several aspects of local insect specialization, host use abilities (and loss of these abilities with specialization), host-associated evolutionary divergence, and ecological (including “hybrid”) speciation, with special reference to the generation of biodiversity and the geographic and taxonomic identification of “species borders” for swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations that trace back millions of years to recent and very local specialized populations, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of localized ecological patterns and genetically based evolutionary processes. They have served as a useful group for evaluating the feeding specialization/physiological efficiency hypothesis. They have shown how the abiotic (thermal) environment interacts with host nutrirional suitability to generate “voltinism/suitability” gradients in specialization or preference latitudinally, and geographical mosaics locally. Several studies reviewed here suggest strongly that the oscillation hypothesis for speciation does have considerable merit, but at the same time, some species-level host specializations may lead to evolutionary dead-ends, especially with rapid environmental/habitat changes involving their host plants. Latitudinal gradients in species richness and degree of herbivore feeding specialization have been impacted by recent developments in ecological genetics and evolutionary ecology. Localized insect–plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious, with simple definitions still debated. However, molecular analyses combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies, have already begun to unveil some answers for many important ecological/evolutionary questions.},

It has therefore been suggested that an ability of consumers to rewire to novel prey should mitigate the consequences of species loss by reducing the risk of cascading extinction. Using a new modelling approach on natural and computer-generated food webs we find that, on the contrary, rewiring often aggravates the effects of species loss. This is because rewiring can lead to overexploitation of resources, which eventually causes extinction cascades. Such a scenario is particularly likely if prey species cannot escape predation when rare and if predators are efficient in exploiting novel prey. Indeed, rewiring is a two-edged sword; it might be advantageous for individual predators in the short term, yet harmful for long-term system persistence.},

	abstract = {. Community assembly rules are often inferred from patterns in presence-absence matrices. A challenging problem in the analysis of presence-absence matrices has been to devise a null model algorithm to produce random matrices with fixed row and column sums. Previous studies by Roberts and Stone [(1990) Oecologia 83:560–567] and Manly [(1995) Ecology 76:1109–1115] used a "Sequential Swap" algorithm in which submatrices are repeatedly swapped to produce null matrices. Sanderson et al. [(1998) Oecologia 116:275–283] introduced a "Knight's Tour" algorithm that fills an empty matrix one cell at a time. In an analysis of the presence-absence matrix for birds of the Vanuatu islands, Sanderson et al. obtained different results from Roberts and Stone and concluded that "results from previous studies are generally flawed". However, Sanderson et al. did not investigate the statistical properties of their algorithm. Using simple probability calculations, we demonstrate that their Knight's Tour is biased and does not sample all unique matrices with equal frequency. The bias in the Knight's Tour arises because the algorithm samples exhaustively at each step before retreating in sequence. We introduce an unbiased Random Knight's Tour that tests only a small number of cells and retreats by removing a filled cell from anywhere in the matrix. This algorithm appears to sample unique matrices with equal frequency. The Random Knight's Tour and Sequential Swap algorithms generate very similar results for the large Vanuatu matrix, and for other presence-absence matrices we tested. As a further test of the Sequential Swap, we constructed a set of 100 random matrices derived from the Vanuatu matrix, analyzed them with the Sequential Swap, and found no evidence that the algorithm is prone to Type I errors (rejecting the null hypothesis too frequently). These results support the original conclusions of Roberts and Stone and are consistent with Gotelli's [(2000) Ecology 81:2606–2621] Type I and Type II error tests for the Sequential Swap. In summary, Sanderson et al.'s Knight's Tourgenerates large variances and does not sample matrices equiprobably. In contrast, the Sequential Swap generates results that are very similar to those of an unbiased Random Knight's Tour, and is not overly prone to Type I or Type II errors. We suggest that the statistical properties of proposed null model algorithms be examined carefully, and that their performance judged by comparisons with artificial data sets of known structure. In this way, Type I and Type II error frequencies can be quantified, and different algorithms and indices can be compared meaningfully.},

In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Connor and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's  checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do not co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic “island lists” of species in an archipelago or standardized “sample lists” of species collected with equal sampling effort.

	abstract = {Ecological fitting is the process whereby organisms colonize and persist in novel environments, use novel resources or form novel associations with other species as a result of the suites of traits that they carry at the time they encounter the novel condition. This paper has four major aims. First, we review the original concept of ecological fitting and relate it to the concept of exaptation and current ideas on the positive role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution. Second, we propose phenotypic plasticity, correlated trait evolution and phylogenetic conservatism as specific mechanisms behind ecological fitting. Third, we attempt to operationalize the concept of ecological fitting by providing explicit definitions for terms. From these definitions, we propose a simple conceptual model of ecological fitting. Using this model, we demonstrate the differences and similarities between ecological fitting and ecological resource tracking and illustrate the process in the context of species colonizing new areas and forming novel associations with other species. Finally, we discuss how ecological fitting can be both a precursor to evolutionary diversity or maintainer of evolutionary stasis, depending on conditions. We conclude that ecological fitting is an important concept for understanding topics ranging from the assembly of ecological communities and species associations, to biological invasions, to the evolution of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {* The relative importance of specialized and generalized plant-pollinator relationships is contentious, yet analyses usually avoid direct measures of pollinator quality (effectiveness), citing difficulties in collecting such data in the field and so relying on visitation data alone.


* We demonstrate that single-visit deposition (SVD) of pollen on virgin stigmas is a practical measure of pollinator effectiveness, using 13 temperate and tropical plant species. For each flower the most effective pollinator measured from SVD was as predicted from its pollination syndrome based on traditional advertisement and reward traits. Overall, c. 40\% of visitors were not effective pollinators (range 0–78\% for different flowers); thus, flower–pollinator relationships are substantially more specialized than visitation alone can reveal.


* Analyses at species level are crucial, as significant variation in SVD occurred within both higher-level taxonomic groups (genus, family) and within functional groups.


* Other measures sometimes used to distinguish visitors from pollinators (visit duration, frequency, or feeding behaviour in flowers) did not prove to be suitable proxies.


* Distinguishing between ‘pollinators’ and ‘visitors’ is therefore crucial, and true ‘pollination networks’ should include SVD to reveal pollinator effectiveness (PE). Generating such networks, now underway, could avoid potential misinterpretations of the conservation values of flower visitors, and of possible extinction threats as modelled in existing networks.},

Land managers and ecologists can use centrality indices, a group of network statistics that measure the relative importance of individuals within a community, to objectively determine the contribution of particular plant species to overall restoration efforts. Our objective was to compare the role of flowers planted as part of the restoration effort to those plants volunteering at the restoration site, either native adventives or non-native invaders, in support of the pollinator community. Further, we sought to determine how this relationship varied with changes in relative floral abundance. We found that plants cultivated as part of the restoration effort were preferred by pollinators, attracted the greatest abundance and richness of pollinators, and were the most central in our plant-pollinator networks compared to volunteers, despite the greater abundance of volunteer plants across the site. We also found that the role of all plants was density dependent; plants of every group attracted more pollinators in plots where they had greater relative abundance. We conclude that centrality indices provide a tool for planning and monitoring the restoration of important functional relationships and allow land managers and ecologists to objectively determine the contribution of particular plants to overall community structure and function.},

Recent work has highlighted how it is not species diversity per se but rather the interactions between organisms that breathes life into ecosystems. Thus, the real challenge to preserving and restoring biodiversity on islands is not to only focus on species themselves, but more importantly on maintaining and restoring the integrity of interactions between the species. Here we argue that mutualistic plant–animal interactions play a pivotal role with regards to conservation and restoration on islands. Furthermore, these interactions are ideally suited for inter-island comparisons due to ecological and evolutionary similarities across geographical and taxonomical boundaries. The similarities include highly generalised mutualistic systems, the evolution and readjustment of plant reproductive traits, and a disharmony in taxonomic groups of mutualists, compared to continental ecosystems. We highlight past and present threats to island plant–animal mutualisms, as well as the challenges and opportunities inherent to these interactions. In particular, we (1) argue that mutualistic networks provide an ideal approach to collect information and advance our knowledge on the systems, (2) suggest the use of interactions as biodiversity monitoring and assessment tools, (3) highlight the differences and similarities between pollination and seed dispersal interactions in the context of restoration, and (4) briefly discuss the ambiguous role of alien invasive species in the management of mutualistic interactions. Finally, we highlight how a recently proposed but controversial restoration strategy, rewilding, can be gainfully applied to and further advanced in island settings.},

These mutualisms are unlikely to reinstate themselves until all of the resource requirements of pollinators have been met. By meeting these requirements, projects can improve their long-term success. We hypothesized that pollinator assemblage and structure and stability of plant–pollinator networks depend both on aspects of the surrounding landscape and of the restoration effort itself. We predicted that pollinator species diversity and network stability would be negatively associated with distance from remnant habitat, but that local floral diversity might rescue pollinator diversity and network stability in locations distant from the remnant. We created plots of native prairie on a reclaimed strip mine in central Ohio, U.S.A. that ranged in floral diversity and isolation from the remnant habitat. We found that the pollinator diversity declined with distance from the remnant habitat. Furthermore, reduced pollinator diversity in low floral diversity plots far from the remnant habitat was associated with loss of network stability. High floral diversity, however, compensated for losses in pollinator diversity in plots far from the remnant habitat through the attraction of generalist pollinators. Generalist pollinators increased network connectance and plant-niche overlap. As a result, network robustness of high floral diversity plots was independent of isolation. We conclude that the aspects of the restoration effort itself, such as floral community composition, can be successfully tailored to incorporate the restoration of pollinators and improve success given a particular landscape context.},

	abstract = {1.  The evaluation of restoration measures is an important task of conservation biology. Inland sand dunes and dry, oligotrophic grasslands have become rare habitat types in large parts of Central Europe and their restoration and management is of major importance for the preservation of many endangered plant and insect species. Within such habitats, it is important to restore key ecosystem services, such as pollination networks. As wild bees are the most important pollinators in many ecosystems, they represent a suitable key group to evaluate restoration measures. Furthermore, the recent decline of many bee species and the potential ecological and economic consequences are currently topics of strong scientific interest. 2.  We studied the succession of bee communities in response to restoration measures of sand dunes and sand grasslands and compared these communities with those of old sand dune complexes. 3.  Our results show that wild bees respond rapidly to restoration measures indicated by a high species richness and abundance. The community structure of bees at restoration sites converged only slightly to those of the target sites. A higher similarity was found between bee communities at the restoration sites (sand dunes and grasslands), indicating that their close proximity was an important determinant of species overlap. Environmental factors such as the number of entomophilous plant species and moisture had a strong influence on wild bee species composition. 4.
Synthesis and applications. The restoration of inland sand dune complexes provides opportunities for colonization by a diverse wild bee community. Although it is difficult to establish a given target community, restoration measures gave rise to a high pollinator diversity and abundance, suggesting that community function can be re-established.},

Although the negative effects of invasive species are globally recognized, little is known about the potential positive impacts they can have on other species in the ecosystems they invade. However, the persistence of invaders in a wide range of ecological communities may mean that they provide resources and refuge for threatened native species, or supplement ecosystem services.


Location

Agroecosystems in the USA.


Methods

We use a 2-year field experiment to explore the potential positive and negative impacts of an invasive thistle (Carduus acanthoides) on the composition of the resident community of foraging insects. The presence or absence of the thistle was the only difference in experimental and control plots comprising a background community of ten flowering annual species.


Results

We demonstrate that the invasive thistle is both highly visited and strongly preferred by bees relative to other flowering species. Bee abundance was 302\% higher and bee species richness 35\% higher in habitat patches where the thistle was present compared to where it was absent. In addition, the abundance of Bombus species, a native group recently found to be in decline, was 479\% higher when the thistle was present.


Main conclusions

Our results suggest that, despite causing significant problems, the invasion of this non-native species may also provide crucial benefits via floral resources for pollinators. Benefits, such as the floral resources that invaders provide to pollinators, should also be taken into account in conservation and invader management plans. Eradication or complete removal of invasive species which provision insects with floral resources could have unintended negative impacts on the associated pollinator community.},

We showed that although the ant and plant composition of networks changed over space, the central core of generalist species and the structure of networks remained unaltered on a geographic distance of up to 5099 m in the southern Brazilian Amazon. This finding indicates that independently of variation in local and landscape environmental factors, the nonrandom pattern organization of these interacting assemblages do not change. Finally, we suggest that a stable core can increase the potential for coevolutionary convergence of traits among species from both sides of the interaction within the community. These findings contribute to our understanding of the maintenance of biodiversity and coevolutionary processes.},

Here, we apply the concept of a motif profile to a synchronous Boolean network model of the formation of mutualistic ecological communities, focusing on four-node subgraphs. We consider the process by which networks dynamically progress from a random initial condition to an attractor (steady state or limit cycle, collectively viewed in this context as a stable community). While the subgraphs are not classified as motifs in the usual sense of the term, we show that subgraphs with predominantly stabilizing (i.e. beneficial for species persistence) interactions are generally composed of species that are present in the attractor. The converse also holds: subgraphs with predominantly destabilizing (i.e. detrimental for species persistence) interactions are more commonly composed of species that are present in the community only transiently. We discuss our findings in the context of mutualistic ecological networks, and argue that the dynamic motif profile may provide a valuable analytical tool in other networks representing complex dynamic systems.},

	abstract = {Nature is organized into complex, dynamical networks of species and their interactions, which may influence diversity and stability. However, network research is, generally, short-term and depict ecological networks as static structures only, devoid of any dynamics. This hampers our understanding of how nature responds to larger disturbances such as changes in climate. In order to remedy this we studied the long-term (12-yrs) dynamics of a flower-visitation network, consisting of flower-visiting butterflies and their nectar plants. Global network properties, i.e. numbers of species and links, as well as connectance, were temporally stable, whereas most species and links showed a strong temporal dynamics. However, species of butterflies and plants varied bimodally in their temporal persistance: Sporadic species, being present only 1–2(-5) years, and stable species, being present (9-)11–12 years, dominated the networks. Temporal persistence and linkage level of species, i.e. number of links to other species, made up two groups of species: Specialists with a highly variable temporal persistence, and temporally stable species with a highly variable linkage level. Turnover of links of specialists was driven by species turnover, whereas turnover of links among generalists took place through rewiring, i.e. by reshuffling existing interactions. However, in spite of this strong internal dynamics of species and links the network appeared overall stable. If this global stability-local instability phenomenon is general, it is a most astonishing feature of ecological networks.},

	abstract = {Whether restoration programs successfully reinstate ecological interactions remains a contentious and largely untested issue. We investigated plant and pollinator interactions on two old and two restored hay meadows, with the aim of evaluating if quantitative patterns of insect visitation and pollen transport were comparable among old and restored meadows. In terms of structural diversity, few species of plants and insects were shared among the webs. In all four meadows, Diptera and Hymenoptera dominated the visitor community in terms of both species richness and abundance. Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera comprised the remainder of the flower visitors. No significant difference was found between restored and old sites in plant or insect species richness or in plant and insect abundance. In terms of function, the meadows appeared more similar, although a slightly higher proportion of the potential links between plants and insects was realized for old meadows. No difference was found in the proportion of plant species visited, and visited plant species were generalized, with all having more than a single species of insect visitor. We also sampled approximately 400,000 pollen grains from the flower-visiting insects. There were no differences between old and restored sites in the amount of pollen being transported or in the average number of pollen grains per insect. At both types of meadows, Hymenoptera carried most pollen, followed by Diptera. Again, generalization was the norm, with all plants having more than a single species of pollen carrier. No difference was observed in the connectance of pollen transport webs between old and restored sites. Overall, although the four meadows showed considerable structural variation, they showed similarity with regard to the functional processes we studied. Because structural variation is expected among localities, we conclude that the two restoration projects have been successful.},

Using an empirical data set, we show that the way plants connect pollination and herbivory networks is not random and promotes community stability. Analyses of the structure of binary and quantitative networks show different results: the plants’ generalism with regard to pollinators is positively correlated to their generalism with regard to herbivores when considering binary interactions, but not when considering quantitative interactions. We also show that plants that share the same pollinators do not share the same herbivores. However, the way plants connect pollination and herbivory networks promotes stability for both binary and quantitative networks. Our results highlight the relevance of considering the diversity of interaction types in ecological communities, and stress the need to better quantify the costs and benefits of interactions, as well as to develop new metrics characterizing the way different interaction types are combined within ecological networks.},

In this study we analysed 750 quantitative plant–pollinator networks from 28 studies representing diverse biomes worldwide. We show that the potential for one plant species to influence another indirectly via shared pollinators was greater for plants whose resources were more abundant (higher floral unit number and nectar sugar content) and more accessible. The potential indirect influence was also stronger between phylogenetically closer plant species and was independent of plant geographic origin (native vs. non-native). The positive effect of nectar sugar content and phylogenetic proximity was much more accentuated for bees than for other groups. Consequently, the impact of these factors depends on the pollination mode of plants, e.g. bee or fly pollinated. Our findings may help predict which plant species have the greatest importance in the functioning of plant–pollination networks.},

The aim of this study was to determine the probable pollinators of three species of rare arable weed: red hemp-nettle Galeopsis angustifolia, small-flowered catchfly Silene gallica and spreading hedge-parsley Torilis arvensis. Species of arable weed are among those suffering the greatest declines in the UK.
* 2Five field sites were chosen, two of which were sampled in 2 years. Visitation and pollen transport webs were constructed for the entire plant–pollinator community at each site. Visitation webs described the frequency with which each insect species visited each plant species. Pollen transport webs quantified which insect species transported the pollen of which plant species.
* 3A wide range of insect species visited the three plant species. A pollinator importance index was calculated that combined information on both the relative abundance of each insect carrying the pollen of the rare plant and its pollen fidelity. Using this method Galeopsis angustifolia was most likely to be pollinated by Bombus pascuorum at one site and Sphaerophoria scripta at another. Silene gallica was also likely be pollinated by Sphaerophoria scripta.
* 4The pollinator fauna of the three plant species varied considerably across their geographical range, but less from one year to the next.
* 5Synthesis and applications. All three species of rare plant were linked to other plant species in the community by shared pollinators. In many cases these other plant species constituted the primary food sources for the shared pollinators. Therefore, the long-term survival of rare plant populations is likely to depend on the more common plant species in the community. We recommend that management of the rare plants studied here should also include the protection and management of populations of some of the more common plant species in their respective communities.},

	abstract = {We analysed the dynamics of a plant–pollinator interaction network of a scrub community surveyed over four consecutive years. Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not remain constant through time. This change involved both the number and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant–pollinator networks (53\% of the plant species, 21\% of the pollinator species and 4.9\% of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70\% in pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30\%). We conclude that specialization in plant–pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to be generalists or to interact with different partner species when observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance, nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously suggested and (ii) that plant–pollinator interaction networks might be less prone to detrimental effects of disturbance than previously thought. We suggest that this may be due to the opportunistic nature of plant and animal species regarding the available partner resources they depend upon at any particular time.},

	abstract = {The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats by human activities are pervasive phenomena in terrestrial ecosystems across the Earth and the main driving forces behind current biodiversity loss. Animal-mediated pollination is a key process for the sexual reproduction of most extant flowering plants, and the one most consistently studied in the context of habitat fragmentation. By means of a meta-analysis we quantitatively reviewed the results from independent fragmentation studies throughout the last two decades, with the aim of testing whether pollination and reproduction of plant species may be differentially susceptible to habitat fragmentation depending on certain reproductive traits that typify the relationship with and the degree of dependence on their pollinators. We found an overall large and negative effect of fragmentation on pollination and on plant reproduction. The compatibility system of plants, which reflects the degree of dependence on pollinator mutualism, was the only reproductive trait that explained the differences among the species’ effect sizes. Furthermore, a highly significant correlation between the effect sizes of fragmentation on pollination and reproductive success suggests that the most proximate cause of reproductive impairment in fragmented habitats may be pollination limitation. We discuss the conservation implications of these findings and give some suggestions for future research into this area.},

	abstract = {The generalization–specialization continuum exhibited in pollination interactions currently receives much attention. It is well-known that the pollinator assemblage of particular species varies temporally and spatially, and therefore the ecological generalization on pollinators may be a contextual attribute. However, the factors causing such variation and its ecological and evolutionary consequences are still poorly understood. This variation can be caused by spatial or temporal variation in the pollinator community, but also by variation in the plant community. Here, we examined how the floral neighbourhood influenced the generalization on pollinators and the composition of pollinators of six plant species differing in generalization levels and main pollinators. The diversity, identity and density of floral species affected both the level of generalization on pollinators and the composition of visitors of particular plant species. Although the relationships to floral neighbourhood varied considerably among species, generalization level and visitation by uncommon pollinators generally increased with floral diversity and richness. The generalization level of the neighbourhood was negatively related to the generalization level of the focal species in two species. The number of flowers of the pollinator-sharing species and the number of flowers of the focal species had different effects on the composition of visits in different species; attributable to differences in facilitation/competition for pollinator attraction. We propose that an important ecological implication of our results is that variation in species interactions caused by the pollination context may result in increased community stability. The main evolutionary implication of our results is that selection on flower and pollinator traits may depend, to an unknown extent, on the composition of the co-flowering plant community.},

	abstract = {Outcrossing in plants is influenced by the availability of pollinators and compatible mates, both of which may be modified by the population and community context in which plant–pollinator interactions occur. Although indirect interactions among plants through shared pollinators are often expected to be competitive, pollinator sharing may be beneficial when plant species jointly attract or maintain populations of pollinators. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that pollinator-sharing congeners facilitate reproduction in a focal taxon, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana, and that positive interactions are most pronounced in small and sparse populations. Population surveys revealed that C. x. xantiana frequently coexists with pollinator-sharing congeners except at the periphery of its range. Populations varied extensively in size and density, with small populations more likely associated with pollinator-sharing congeners; conversely, populations occurring alone were more likely large. Flowering schedules in Clarkia communities ranged from segregated to aggregated. Although there was not strong evidence of character displacement, modes in flowering time were often staggered among Clarkia species resulting in a protracted flowering season within plant communities. Studies of bee pollinator availability in 17 populations and pollen limitation to reproduction in 39 replicate populations revealed that populations occurring with multiple congeners had high pollinator availability and low pollen limitation of reproduction compared to populations occurring alone. Population size was inversely related to pollen limitation but did not affect pollinator availability, suggesting that Allee effects were caused by mate limitation. Intraspecific interactions were also positive at a fine spatial scale where pollen deposition increased with the density of closely neighboring conspecifics across 11 populations. Overall, inter- and intraspecific interactions through shared pollinators were generally facilitative, suggesting that population viability and the coexistence of ecologically similar Clarkia species may be promoted by positive reproductive interactions.},

	abstract = {SummaryFrom 1985–1987, patterns of fruit and seed set were studied in a population of mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), a clonal, self-incompatible herb found in deciduous woods in eastern North America. Mayapple flowers do not produce nectar, but depend on infrequent visits by nectar-seeking queen bumble bees for pollination. In all years female reproductive success in mayapple colonies was influenced by colony size (number of flowers), by the distance to neighbouring colonies and by proximity to lousewort plants (Pedicularis canadensis), a prolific nectar producer heavily visited by bumble bees. In all years fruit and seed set were greater in mayapple colonies {\textless}25 m from lousewort flowers than in matched colonies which were {\textgreater}50 m from lousewort. In 1985 and 1987 the frequency of queen bumble bee visits to flowers in colonies close to lousewort was about four times greater than to distant colonies. In 1986 I removed about 80\% of lousewort flowers to test whether the enhanced fruit and seed set in mayapples close to lousewort was pollinator mediated. Mayapple colonies close to flowerless lousewort patches did not differ in fruit or seed set from matched colonies {\textgreater}50 m from lousewort. In contrast, mayapples close to flowering lousewort patches had greater fruit and seed set compared with distant colonies. Over all years, a larger proportion of mayapples close to flowering lousewort patches had enhanced fruit and seed set compared with colonies close to louseworts without flowers. Though rarely documented, this type of facilitative interaction between plants that are highly attractive to pollinators (“magnet” species), and co-flowering species that are rarely visited by pollinators, may be widespread in plant communities.},

We evaluated resource availability on meadows of low intensity (low/unfertilised, mown once or twice per year) and meadows of high-intensity land use (high fertilisation, mown twice or thrice) before and after the first mowing in relation to network specialisation, species richness and composition of flower visitors.

We studied 40 meadows, simultaneously sampling one meadow of low intensity and one meadow of high-intensity land use. Each survey yielded a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found during 6 h in an area of 1000 m2.

In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species. Species composition of plants and flower visitors differed considerably between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43\% in plants and 42\% in flower visitors. Complementary specialisation of flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less specialised than beetles and butterflies, and bees had the highest degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows of low-intensity land use were significantly richer in flowering plant, bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plant–flower visitor interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land use. However, later in the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant species richness, being higher on meadows of low-intensity land use.

We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from differences in grassland management may alter plant–flower visitor interactions. Moreover, an impoverishment of flower diversity has stronger effects on the diversity and species composition of specialised flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors.},

	abstract = {Plants with poorly attractive flowers or with little floral rewards may have inadequate pollinator service, which in turn reduces seed output. However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called ‘magnet-species’). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an ‘invasional meltdown’. The magnet effect of Lupinus on Carduus found in this study seems to be one the first examples of indirect facilitative interactions via increased pollination among invasive species.},

Noticeably rare, however, are attempts to quantify temporal variation in the structure of plant–pollinator networks, and to determine whether the status of species as specialists or generalists is stable. Here we show that network structure varied through time in a montane meadow community from southern California, USA, in that pollinator species did not form the same links with plant species across years. Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species in the network varied among summers, as did the identity of those species involved in relationships that appeared to be reciprocally specialized within any one summer. These differences appear to be related to severe drought conditions experienced in the second summer of the 3 year study. In contrast to this variation, the pollinator community remained similarly highly nested in all three summers, even though species were packed into the nested matrix differently from year to year. These results suggest that plant–pollinator networks vary in detail through time, while retaining some basic topological properties. This dynamic aspect of community-scale interactions has implications for both ecological and evolutionary inferences about pollination mutualisms.},

	abstract = {* 1Increased agricultural intensification has led to well-documented declines in the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands.
* 2Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 × 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006.
* 3Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments.
* 4Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance.
* 5Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment schemes in the UK and Europe.},

	abstract = {Most recent studies describing pollination networks are based on observed flower visits, and few have explicitly tested if the floral visitors actually carry pollen. Since floral visitors can vary in their ability to remove and transfer pollen, it is important to show that visitation patterns reflect effective pollination. Given the difficulty of measuring per-visit pollen deposition at the community scale, a first step is to examine the amount of conspecific pollen carried by insect visitors. Here I compared the plant–animal visitation network with the pollen-transport network, estimated from insect pollen loads, for a montane meadow community from southern California, USA. Visitation and pollen-transport networks were positively associated with each other in both 2001 and 2002. However, the exclusion of visitors that do not carry any conspecific pollen reveals that pollen-transport networks are more specialized from the plants’ perspective and that species are involved in fewer mutualistic interactions compared with estimates derived from visitation frequencies. Although conspecific pollen loads were smaller in 2002, bees tended to carry the largest conspecific loads in both years and were responsible for transporting the most pollen. These results suggest that, although visitation networks are suitable first-order approximations of pollination networks, information on which visitors carry conspecific pollen, and in what amounts, is crucial for distinguishing between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.},

	abstract = {It has been debated whether pollination success in nonrewarding plants that flower in association with nectar-producing plants will be diminished by competition for pollinator visits or, alternatively, enhanced through increased local abundance of pollinators (the magnet species effect). We experimentally evaluated these effects using the nonrewarding bumblebee-pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated nectar-producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of nectar-producing plants (Geum rivale and Allium schoenoprasum) than for individuals placed outside (∼20 m away) such patches. These results provide support for the existence of a facilitative magnet species effect in the interaction between certain nectar plants and A. morio. To determine the spatial scale of these interactions, we correlated the visitation rate to flowers of A. morio with the density of sympatric nectar plants in 1-m2 and 100-m2 plots centered around groups of translocated plants, and at the level of whole meadows (∼0.5–2 ha). Visitation rate to flowers of A. morio was not correlated with the 1-m2 patch density of G. rivale and A. schoenoprasum, but showed a significant positive relationship with density of these nectar plants in 100-m2 plots. In addition, visitation to flowers of A. morio was strongly and positively related to the density of A. schoenoprasum at the level of the meadow. Choice experiments showed that bees foraging on the purple flowers of A. schoenoprasum (a particularly effective magnet species) visit the purple flowers of A. morio more readily (47.6\% of choices) than bees foraging on the yellow flowers of Lotus corniculatus (17\% of choices). Overall similarity in flower color and shape may increase the probability that a pollinator will temporarily shift from a nectar-producing “magnet” plant to a nonrewarding plant. We discuss the possibility of a mimicry continuum between those orchids that exploit instinctive food-seeking behavior of pollinators and those that show an adaptive resemblance to nectar-producing plants.},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbance can alter the structure of ecological networks in ways that have population consequences. For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded information about nest location, and monitored nest survival. For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested that factors other than invasion were responsible for network changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological networks may be more challenging than anticipated.},

	abstract = {Cryptic function loss occurs when the ecological function of an animal population is significantly altered as a result of disturbance, even though the species is still present in the ecosystem. We reviewed the evidence for cryptic function loss to be widespread among seed disperser populations that persist under disturbed conditions. We found overwhelming support for the seed dispersal effectiveness of animals to be negatively impacted by all forms of disturbance (population decline, changes in community assemblages, habitat change, and climate change). However, seed dispersal was positively affected in some examples, particularly when extirpation of an interacting frugivore or predator enhanced fruit consumption. It is essential that we improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which seed dispersal is lost, even though the disperser's population remains viable, as there are many unanswered questions that hinder an objective understanding of this threat. We need to consider how seed dispersal effectiveness is determined by species population size and small changes in phenotypes. In addition, we must increase our understanding of behavioral impacts on seed dispersal and how it might be regulated by disturbance. The complexity and flexibility of seed dispersal interactions could mean that communities are adaptable to many changes; alternatively, ecosystems might be severely threatened by cryptic function loss because of the myriad ways in which multiple frugivore populations can be simultaneously affected and the fact that early signs of function loss can be hidden by stable population sizes.},

Both biological mechanisms and chance could drive these patterns, but the relative importance of these factors has not been separated. We established a field experiment consisting of 102 monospecific plots of 17 native plant species, from which we collected 6,713 specimens of 52 bee species over four years. We used these data and a null model to determine whether bee species’ foraging choices varied more or less over time beyond the variation expected by chance. Thus we provide the first quantitative definition of rewiring and fidelity as these terms are used in the literature on interaction networks. All 52 bee species varied in plant partner choice across years, but for 27 species this variation was indistinguishable from random partner choice. Another 11 species showed rewiring, varying more across years than expected by chance, while 14 species showed fidelity, indicating that they both prefer certain plant species and are consistent in those preferences across years. Our study shows that rewiring and fidelity both exist in mutualist networks, but that once sampling effects have been accounted for, they are less common than has been reported in the ecological literature.

At the community level, the observed overlap in trophic niches was higher than expected by chance, both for diet and foraging time.

Here, we analyzed two assemblages of corbiculate bees (Apoidea, Apidae) in two geographically distinct urban areas in Brazil. In both study areas, apid bees visiting flowers were captured with an insect net. Surveys were performed biweekly and alternately in each area, over a 1-year period. Both urban areas were very similar for most indices. The two social bee–plant networks were significantly nested, a pattern usually described for bee–plant networks and somehow expected in our study, considering the recognized behavior of social apid bees in exploring a wide range of plant species. The modularity measures were low and very similar for the networks of both urban areas, a finding that could be due at least in part to the low phylogenetic distance between corbiculate bees and the broad dietary habits of the social apid bees. Network-level indices showed that both bee assemblages had a relatively low niche overlap, indicating that the set of social apid species studied exploited differently the arrays of plants available. Species level index (resource range) showed that in both urban areas, Trigona spinipes (Fabr.) and Apis mellifera L. showed the higher number of interactions, a result that demonstrates the importance of these species in social bee–plant interaction networks in urban areas. Similarly to other ecosystems, these two apid species behaved as super-generalists in the two urban areas surveyed herein.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

Despite the importance of competition in structuring patterns of ant–plant interactions, this biological mechanism has been largely ignored in studies involving ant–plant networks. In this study we investigate the role of ant dominance hierarchy in structuring an ecological network involving ants and EFN-bearing plants in a tropical coastal environment in Mexico. We show that within a nested ant–plant network, ant species found in the central core of highly interacting species were competitively superior, showing massive recruitment and resource domination, compared with peripheral species with fewer interactions. Moreover, we also observed that both central and peripheral ant species have the ability to quickly find the food resource. However, after 2 h of observation, central ant species are more frequently collected on the food resource when compared with peripheral species. We hypothesize that the existence of a central core of competitive ant species may indicate that most plant species found within ant–plant networks could be better protected against herbivory by these dominant ant species. In short, our results highlight the importance of competition and monopolization in the resource use by ants in the maintenance of the nested pattern in ant–plant mutualistic networks. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 113, 405–414.},

Although basically a sugary liquid food, nectar and honeydew are composed of different nutrients and offered in distinct ways; thus, ants must interact differently with plants and hemipterans. In this study we assessed the availability and dominance of nectar of extrafloral nectaries and honeydew of sap-sucking hemipterans (i.e., sugar-based resources) as mechanisms regulating interaction frequency and structuring ant-plant-hemipteran networks. We studied 12 plant species (240 shrubs, 20 per species) and 12 hemipteran species (240 aggregations, 20 per species) that interacted with 26 ant species in an area of Rupestrian Fields (Rocky Montane Savannah), Brazil. We observed that the 7 ant species that collected honeydew were a subset of the 25 ant species feeding on nectar, but the highly interacted species Camponotus crassus was the same for both subnetworks. The ant-plant subnetwork exhibited a nested pattern of interaction with a low degree of specialization, while the ant-hemipteran subnetwork exhibited lower nestedness but higher specialization. We found a positive relationship between the offer of EFNs and the number of interactions with ants, probably resulting from reduced competition in plants with high availability of EFNs. However, hemipteran species that were most abundant did not interact with more species of ants, probably because of the numerical dominance of the species tending all hemipteran aggregations, regardless of size. However, segregation between ant species was higher than expected by chance for both plants and hemipterans, confirming a deterministic factor (i.e., competition between ant species) regulating the frequency of interactions. In summary, the availability of ENFs seems to be an important mechanism regulating ant-plant interactions, while numerical dominance seems to be an important mechanism structuring ant-hemipteran interactions.},

Abstract
The extent to which behavioural choices reflect fine-tuned evolutionary adaptation remains an open debate. For herbivorous insects, the preference–performance hypothesis (PPH) states that female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their offspring fare best. In this study, we use meta-analysis to assess the balance of evidence for and against the PPH, and to evaluate the role of individual factors proposed to influence host selection by female insects. We do so in an explicitly bitrophic context (herbivores versus plants). Overall, our analyses offer clear support for the PPH: Offspring survive better on preferred plant types, and females lay more eggs on plant types conducive to offspring performance. We also found evidence for an effect of diet breadth on host choice: female preference for ‘good quality plants’ was stronger in oligophagous insects than in polyphagous insects. Nonetheless, despite the large numbers of preference–performance studies conducted to date, sample sizes in our meta-analysis are low due to the inconsistent format used by authors to present their results. To improve the situation, we invite authors to contribute to the data base emerging from this work, with the aim of reaching a strengthened synthesis of the subject field.},

	abstract = {1. Shared enemies may link the dynamics of their prey. Recently, quantitative food webs have been used to infer that herbivorous insect species attacked by the same major parasitoid species will affect each other negatively through apparent competition. Nonetheless, theoretical work predicts several alternative outcomes, including positive effects. 2. In this paper, we use an experimental approach to link food web patterns to realized population dynamics. First, we construct a quantitative food web for three dominant leaf miner species on the oak Quercus robur. We then measure short- and long-term indirect effects by increasing leaf miner densities on individual trees. Finally, we test whether experimental results are consistent with natural leaf miner dynamics on unmanipulated trees. 3. The quantitative food web shows that all leaf miner species share a minimum of four parasitoid species. While only a small fraction of the parasitoid pool is shared among Tischeria ekebladella and each of two Phyllonorycter species, the parasitoid communities of the congeneric Phyllonorycter species overlap substantially. 4. Based on the structure of the food web, we predict strong short- and long-term indirect interactions between the Phyllonorycter species, and limited interactions between them and T. ekebladella. As T. ekebladella is the main source of its own parasitoids, we expect to find intraspecific density-dependent parasitism in this species. 5. Consistent with these predictions, parasitism in T. ekebladella was high on trees with high densities of conspecifics in the previous generation. Among leaf miner species sharing more parasitoids, we found positive rather than negative interactions among years. No short-term indirect interactions (i.e. indirect interactions within a single generation) were detected. 6. Overall, this study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that herbivores with overlapping parasitoid communities may exhibit independent population dynamics – or even apparent mutualism. Hence, it proves the potential for versatile indirect interactions in nature, and suggests that the link between patterns in food web structure and realized population dynamics should be verified by rigorous experiments.},

We investigated the structure of 216 quantitative antagonistic networks comprising insect hosts and their parasitoids, drawn from 28 studies from the High Arctic to the tropics. Key metrics of network structure were strongly affected by the size of the interaction matrix (i.e. the total number of interactions documented between individuals) and by the taxonomic diversity of the host taxa involved. After controlling for these sampling effects, quantitative networks showed no consistent structural patterns across latitude and host guilds, suggesting that there may be basic rules for how sets of antagonists interact with resource species. Furthermore, the strong association between network size and structure implies that many apparent spatial and temporal variations in network structure may prove to be artefacts.},

	abstract = {Why is the World green – what keeps herbivores, and herbivorous insects in particular, from consuming all of their food? When this question was first posed, the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects was hotly disputed. While modern ecologists may agree that impacts from several different directions will affect local insect densities, the bottom-up vs top-down jargon seems to be stuck in a unidimensional world. Here, we argue that the strength of almost every bottom-up and top-down force is likely to vary in space, and that in itself, spatial structure invokes new processes which defy classification in the traditional bottom-up top-down scheme. To understand the relative importance of different forces keeping herbivore numbers in check, we feel that we need a fresh synthesis between the novel paradigm of spatial ecology and the classical paradigms of top-down and bottom-up studies. This synthesis requires a consideration of forces beyond the standard framework of top-down vs bottom-up effects, and should be based on comparing the relative strength of such forces at several sites in a spatially explicit framework. Overall, we should switch our focus from whether the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up factors vary in space to why there is variation, how much variation there is, and at what spatial scale(s) it occurs.},

	abstract = {The coexistence of plant species in species-rich tropical forests can be promoted by specialised enemies acting in a negatively density-dependent manner. While survival of tropical tree seedlings is often negatively density-dependent, the causes have rarely been identified. We tested whether insects and plant pathogens cause density-dependent seedling recruitment and survival in five forest tree species in Belize, Central America. We manipulated densities of seeds or newly germinated seedlings in small (1 m2 or 0.25 m2) plots close to fruiting conspecific trees. Using a factorial design, we excluded enemies from subsets of the plots with fungicides and insecticides. Seed germination (for two species) and early seedling survival (for all species) were monitored at approximately weekly intervals for up to eight weeks, during the period when plants are likely to be most susceptible to natural enemies. In Terminalia amazonia, seed germination was negatively density-dependent and the proportion of seeds germinating increased when insects were excluded. However, the magnitude of the insecticide effect was independent of density. The only significant density effect for survival of young seedlings was in Acacia polyphylla; counter to expectation, seedling survival was higher at high densities. In a few cases pesticide application had a significant effect on seedling survival, but in only one case (Terminalia amazonia) was a significant pesticide × density interaction detected. Our results caution against generalising from studies conducted on a single species at a single time and place and illustrate the challenges of experimentally testing for enemy-mediated negative density-dependence. Experimental outcomes are likely to depend on the spatial scale at which the principal enemies disperse and respond to plant density, and the timescales over which they act. Gathering information on these variables will improve our understanding of the natural histories of tropical forest species and help inform the design of future experiments.},

Abstract
The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is a leading explanation for plant-species diversity in tropical forests. It suggests that specialized natural enemies decrease offspring survival at high densities beneath parents, giving locally rarer species an advantage. This mechanism, in its original form, assumes that density dependence is overcompensating: mortality must be disproportionately high at the highest densities, with few offspring recruiting below their parents. We tested this assumption using parallel shadehouse and field density-series experiments on seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis. We found strong, overcompensating mortality driven by fungal pathogens, causing 90\% (shadehouse) or 100\% (field) mortality within 4 weeks of germination, and generating a negative relationship between initial and final seedling densities. Fungicide treatment led to much lower, density-independent, mortality. Overcompensating mortality was extremely rapid, and could be missed without detailed monitoring. Such dynamics may prevent dead trees from being replaced by conspecifics, promoting coexistence as envisioned by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.},

	abstract = {When examined at any moment in time, different parts of an individual oak tree exhibit almost as large differences in quality as different trees. But how consistent are such patterns in time? In this paper, we use intraclass correlations to assess the temporal consistency of host plant quality at several spatial scales. As measures of quality, we use both individual chemical attributes (phenolic contents) and the overall performance (larval survival) of the host-specific leaf-miner Tischeria ekebladella. Concentrations of 24 phenolic compounds were monitored on seven trees throughout a season. Variation in mine initiation and larval survival rates was assessed for individuals transplanted to another set of trees early versus later in the season, while year-to-year variation in larval survival was studied through stratified surveys of wild individuals during three years. At all time scales considered, measures of host quality were moderately consistent: a tree favourable in quality at one point in time often remained so, but there was abundant variation around this relationship (ρ=0.4–0.6). One hierarchical level deviated from this general pattern: on individual branches, larval survival rates varied randomly among years (ρ=0). Our study suggests that the quality of trees, and in particular of smaller units within trees, may be difficult to predict both in space and in time. To account for this, insects might benefit from adopting a bet-hedging strategy when selecting resources.},

In contrast, the impact of intraspecific behavioural changes on their efficacy as pollinators has seldom been quantified.


* We studied a self-incompatible shrub Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) and its hummingbird pollinators, which adjust their behaviour according to floral resource availability. Fluorescence microscopy was used to access pollen tube growth and incompatibility reaction in pistils after a single visit of territorial or intruder hummingbirds in two populations. To characterise the plant populations and possible differences in resource availability between areas we used a three-term quadrat variance method to detect clusters of floral resources.


* Within-species variation in foraging behaviour, but not species identity, affected pollinator efficacy. Effectively, hummingbirds intruding into territories deposited more compatible pollen grains on P. rigida stigmas than territory holders in both study areas. Additionally, territory holders deposited more incompatible than compatible pollen grains.


* Our results imply that intraspecific foraging behaviour variation has consequences for pollination success. Quantifying such variation and addressing the implications of intraspecific variability contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and consequences of plant–pollinator interactions.},

	abstract = {The assemblages of root-feeding chrysomelid larvae from 21 locally common tree species were studied in a secondary tropical forest in New Guinea and compared with confamilial larvae and adults feeding on the foliage. Larval host plants were inferred from adults emerging from the soil containing the roots of known tree species. In total, 2495 chrysomelids from 100 species were reared from the roots. Almost 90\% of adults in the forest canopy recruited from the species with root-feeding larvae, while species with leaf-feeding larvae represented 1\% of individuals (the feeding guild for the remaining 9\% was unknown). The root-feeding larvae were thus more important in tropical than temperate forests, possibly because of predation pressure by ants on tropical vegetation. The number of chrysomelids emerging annually from the soil in 1 ha of the forest was approximately 0.2 million. Root-feeding larvae were polyphagous as their modal host range included three or four from the six plant families studied. The lack of correlation between the phylogenetic distance of tree species and the similarity of their chrysomelid assemblages indicated that host choice was not constrained by plant phylogeny. The host range of larvae feeding on roots was as wide as that of the conspecific adults feeding on the foliage. The density and species composition of larval and adult assemblages on the studied trees were not correlated. These results suggest that even studies restricted to adult assemblages, which represent a majority of chrysomelid studies, can be informative, as the composition of adult assemblages is not necessarily constrained by larval host-plant selection.},

	abstract = {Optimal foraging theory predicts that individuals should become more opportunistic when intraspecific competition is high and preferred resources are scarce. This density-dependent diet shift should result in increased diet breadth for individuals as they add previously unused prey to their repertoire. As a result, the niche breadth of the population as a whole should increase. In a recent study, R. Svanbäck and D. I. Bolnick confirmed that intraspecific competition led to increased population diet breadth in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). However, individual diet breadth did not expand as resource levels declined. Here, we present a new method based on complex network theory that moves beyond a simple measure of diet breadth, and we use the method to reexamine the stickleback experiment. This method reveals that the population as a whole added new types of prey as stickleback density was increased. However, whereas foraging theory predicts that niche expansion is achieved by individuals accepting new prey in addition to previously preferred prey, we found that a subset of individuals ceased to use their previously preferred prey, even though other members of their population continued to specialize on the original prey types. As a result, populations were subdivided into groups of ecologically similar individuals, with diet variation among groups reflecting phenotype-dependent changes in foraging behavior as prey density declined. These results are consistent with foraging theory if we assume that quantitative trait variation among consumers affects prey preferences, and if cognitive constraints prevent individuals from continuing to use their formerly preferred prey while adding new prey.},

Phylogenetic constraint of interactions in both native and novel food webs can make some novel interactions predictable. However, many food webs are sparsely sampled, or may include inaccurate interactions. In such cases, it is unclear whether modeling methods are still useful to anticipate novel interactions. We ran bootstrap simulations of host-use models on a Lepidoptera–plant data set to remove native trophic records or add erroneous records in order to observe the effect of missing or erroneous data on the prediction of interactions with novel plants. We found that the model was robust to a large amount of missing interaction records, but lost predictive power with the addition of relatively few erroneous interaction records. The loss of predictive power with missing records was due to inaccuracy in estimating phylogenetic distance between native and novel hosts. Removal of interaction records proportionally to their encounter frequency in the field had little effect on the loss of predictive power. Host-use models may have immediate value for predicting novel interactions from large, but sparsely sampled databases of trophic interactions.},

Moreover, we observed that the multi-interaction networks did not enhance community robustness compared with each of the three independent mutualistic networks when analysed across a range of simulated scenarios of species extinction. By simulating the removal of highly interacting species, we observed that, overall, these species enhance network nestedness and robustness, but decrease modularity. We discuss how the organization of interlinked mutualistic networks may be essential for the maintenance of ecological communities, and therefore the long-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interactive, species-rich communities. We suggest that conserving these keystone mutualists and their interactions is crucial to the persistence of species-rich mutualistic assemblages, mainly because they support other species and shape the network organization.},

This spatial variability has traditionally been analyzed through summary statistics between pairs of populations, therefore missing the simultaneous influence of all populations. More recently, a network approach has been advocated to overcome these limitations. This network approach has been applied to a few cases limited to a single species at a time. The question remains whether similar patterns of spatial genetic variation and similar functional roles for specific patches are obtained for different species. Here we study the networks of genetic variation of four Mediterranean woody plant species inhabiting the same habitat patches in a highly fragmented forest mosaic in Southern Spain. Three of the four species show a similar pattern of genetic variation with well-defined modules or groups of patches holding genetically similar populations. These modules can be thought of as the long-sought-after, evolutionarily significant units or management units. The importance of each patch for the cohesion of the entire network, though, is quite different across species. This variation creates a tremendous challenge for the prioritization of patches to conserve the genetic variation of multispecies assemblages.},

	abstract = {Accelerated tropical landscape changes occurring over recent decades have produced environmental mosaics comprising remaining isolated green areas and mixed land-use types. Our objective was to study the effects of alterations in the natural landscape on the species composition and structure of assemblages of Asteraceae and their endophagous insects through comparisons between cerrado (savanna), pastures and Eucalyptus stands. We first investigated whether similarities between assemblages of Asteraceae and their insects varied among land uses or localities. Secondly, we asked whether assemblages of Eucalyptus stands and pastures are subsets of those within the cerrado. We sampled within randomly deployed transects in 15 areas. Land use was found to be an important factor in determining plant composition similarity; however, locality did not exert any significant influence. Pastures were less similar to one another, suggesting high beta diversity. Similarities among insect assemblages were correlated with plant assemblage composition, but not with land use or locality. Species of Tephritidae were distributed along localities independently of land use. High beta diversity in Asteraceae assemblages among cerrados and pastures was supported by nestedness analysis. Plant assemblages in Eucalyptus stands were subsets of cerrado, but pasture assemblages were only partial subsets. A higher degree of nestedness in insect assemblages than in plant assemblages indicated lower beta diversity within these herbivores. Our data indicate that many herbivores are specialized on widely distributed plant genera. Conservation of Asteraceae species and their flower head insects depends not only on maintenance of landscape fragments but also on the correct matching of management form and land use. Such management may contribute to reducing isolation of plant and insect species by increasing the connectivity of remaining cerrado tracts, allowing population maintenance even at low abundances.},

	abstract = {Frugivorous dacine fruit flies were studied in a lowland tropical rain forest in Papua New Guinea to determine their host specificity, abundance, and the number of species attacking various plant species. Plant species hosted 0–3 fruit fly species at median (1–3 quartile) densities of 1 (0–17) fruit flies per 100 fruits. Fruit flies were mostly specialized to a single plant family (83\% species) and within each family to a single genus (88\% species), while most of the species (66\%) were able to feed on {\textgreater}1 congeneric plant species. Only 30 from the 53 studied plant species were colonized by fruit flies. The plant–fruit fly food web, including these 30 plant species and the total of 29 fruit fly species feeding on them, was divided into 14 compartments, each including 1–8 plant species hosting mutually disjunct assemblages of fruit flies. This structure minimizes indirect interactions among plant species via shared herbivores. The local species pool was estimated at 152±32 (±SE) fruit fly species. Forty per cent of all taxonomically described species known from Papua New Guinea were reared or trapped in our study area. Such a high proportion indicates low beta-diversity of fruit flies. Steiner traps were highly efficient in sampling the lure-responsive fruit fly species as they re-collected 84\% of all species trapped in the same area 5 y before. Fruit fly monitoring by these traps is a cheap, simple and efficient method for the study of spatial and temporal changes in rain-forest communities.},

	abstract = {If related species share enemies, variation in the damage experienced by species within a community may be predictable based on phylogeny. We examined the hypothesis that plant species more closely related to other community members experience greater herbivory by assessing leaf damage to native and exotic plants in two North American communities: an Eastern hardwood forest and a Rocky Mountain montane community. Pairwise phylogenetic distances between focal species and the hundreds of other native species in each community were calculated. We examined the influence of four measures of relatedness within each community: NND (phylogenetic distance to the nearest native neighbor), MPD (mean phylogenetic distance to the native species in the community), and two new metrics, MIPD (mean inverse phylogenetic distance) and INND (inverse nearest neighbor distance). These new metrics assume a nonlinear increase in interaction strength with relatedness; in the context of natural enemies, they posit that the sharing of enemies between any two species increases nonlinearly with their relatedness. Using regression models, we found that herbivore damage decreased with decreasing phylogenetic similarity of focal species to native species (as measured by MIPD) in both sites, although the pattern was significant only for native focal species in the montane community and exotic focal species in the hardwood forest. Similar decreases in herbivory with decreasing relatedness were detected using INND (montane natives) and MPD (hardwood forest exotics). There was no significant relationship between NND and herbivory for any of the four site by focal plant origin combinations. Our results are the first to support the hypothesis that native species can escape attack as a function of their phylogenetic dissimilarity to the larger community of native species, and to demonstrate that exotic species show these patterns in the wild (as opposed to in common gardens). We suggest that phylogenetic distance metrics assuming a nonlinear increase in interaction strength with relatedness show promise for broader application.},

Caterpillar assemblages were strongly dominated by a single species (median 48\% of individuals and 49\% of biomass). They were spatially and temporally constant (median normalized expected species shared (NESS) similarity between assemblages from the same host was greater than or equal to 0.85 for three sites 8–17 km apart as well as for three four–month periods of the year). Further, the median presence of species was 11 months per year. Assemblages on hosts from different families and genera were virtually disjunct (NESS similarity less than 0.05) as the caterpillars were mostly specialized to a single plant family (77\% of species) and, within families, to a single genus (66\% of species), while capable of feeding on multiple congeneric hosts (89\% of species). The dominance of caterpillar assemblages by a small number of specialized species, which also exhibited low spatial and temporal variability, permitted robust and reliable estimates of assemblage composition and between–assemblage similarity from small samples, typically less than 300 individuals per host plant. By contrast, even considerably larger samples were insufficient for estimates of species richness. A sample of 300 individuals was typically obtained from 1050 m2 of foliage sampled during 596 tree inspections (i.e. a particular tree sampled at a particular time) in the course of 19 sampling days (median values from 69 assemblages). These results demonstrate that, contrary to some previous suggestions, insect herbivore assemblages in tropical rainforests have a predictable structure and, as such, are amenable to study.},

	abstract = {Among-population variation in host use is a common phenomenon in herbivorous insects. The simplest and most trivial explanation for such variation in host use is the among-site variation in plant species composition. Another aspect that can influence spatial variation in host use is the relative abundance of each host-plant species compared to all available hosts. Here, we used endophagous insects that develop in flower heads of Asteraceae species as a study system to investigate how plant abundance influences the pattern of host-plant use by herbivorous insects with distinct levels of host-range specialization. Only herbivores recorded on three or more host species were included in this study. In particular, we tested two related hypotheses: 1) plant abundance has a positive effect on the host-plant preference of herbivorous insects, and 2) the relative importance of plant abundance to host-plant preference is greater for herbivorous species that use a wider range of host-plant species. We analyzed 11 herbivore species in 20 remnants of Cerrado in Southeastern Brazil. For 8 out of 11 herbivore species, plant abundance had a positive influence on host use. In contrast to our expectation, both the most specialized and the most generalist herbivores showed a stronger positive effect of plant species abundance in host use. Thus, we found evidence that although the abundance of plant species is a major factor determining the preferential use of host plants, its relative importance is mediated by the host-range specialization of herbivores.},

Gall-forming insect taxa from 32 species of woody tropical plants with resolved phylogenetic relationships were collected and reared, representing 15 families from all the major clades of angiosperms, at three lowland rainforest locations in Madang, Papua New Guinea (PNG). 3. More than 8800 galled plant parts were collected from 78 gall morphospecies at an average of 2.4 per host plant. Total species richness at the sampling sites was estimated to be 83–89. All but one morphospecies were monophagous resulting in an effective specialisation of 0.98. 4. Specific leaf weight, foliar nitrogen, the presence of latex, and the successional preference of plant species all gave a phylogenetic signal, but only plant successional preference influenced the species richness of galls on analysis of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Gall species were distributed randomly among host plant species and showed no preference for any particular plant lineage. Furthermore, most gall-forming taxa were evenly dispersed across the host plant phylogeny. 5. In the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, gall-forming insects are ubiquitous but occur in species-poor assemblages. Local species richness is closely tied to the diversity of angiosperms owing to very high host specificity. 6. Finally, galler species richness data from the literature across habitats and latitudes were compared and suggest that tropical rainforests may be richer in galls than previously acknowledged.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance and increasing knowledge of ecological networks, sampling effort and intrapopulation variation has been widely overlooked. Using continuous daily sampling of ants visiting three plant species in the Brazilian Neotropical savanna, we evaluated for the first time the topological structure over 24 h and species-area relationships (based on the number of extrafloral nectaries available) in individual-based ant-plant networks. We observed that diurnal and nocturnal ant-plant networks exhibited the same pattern of interactions: a nested and non-modular pattern and an average level of network specialization. Despite the high similarity in the ants’ composition between the two collection periods, ant species found in the central core of highly interacting species totally changed between diurnal and nocturnal sampling for all plant species. In other words, this “night-turnover” suggests that the ecological dynamics of these ant-plant interactions can be temporally partitioned (day and night) at a small spatial scale. Thus, it is possible that in some cases processes shaping mutualistic networks formed by protective ants and plants may be underestimated by diurnal sampling alone. Moreover, we did not observe any effect of the number of extrafloral nectaries on ant richness and their foraging on such plants in any of the studied ant-plant networks. We hypothesize that competitively superior ants could monopolize individual plants and allow the coexistence of only a few other ant species, however, other alternative hypotheses are also discussed. Thus, sampling period and species-area relationship produces basic information that increases our confidence in how individual-based ant-plant networks are structured, and the need to consider nocturnal records in ant-plant network sampling design so as to decrease inappropriate inferences.},

	abstract = {Tropical rain forest fragmentation affects biotic interactions in distinct ways. Little is known, however, about how fragmentation affects animal trophic guilds and their patterns of interactions with host plants. In this study, we analyzed changes in biotic interactions in forest fragments by using a multitrophic approach. For this, we classified arthropods associated with Heliconia aurantiaca herbs into broad trophic guilds (omnivores, herbivores and predators) and assessed the topological structure of intrapopulation plant-arthropod networks in fragments and continuous forests. Habitat type influenced arthropod species abundance, diversity and composition with greater abundance in fragments but greater diversity in continuous forest. According to trophic guilds, coleopteran herbivores were more abundant in continuous forest and overall omnivores in fragments. Continuous forest showed a greater diversity of interactions than fragments. Only in fragments, however, did the arthropod community associated with H aurantiaca show a nested structure, suggesting novel and/or opportunistic host-arthropod associations. Plants, omnivores and predators contributed more to nestedness than herbivores. Therefore, Heliconia-arthropod network properties do not appear to be maintained in fragments mainly caused by the decrease of herbivores. Our study contributes to the understanding of the impact of fragmentation on the structure and dynamics of multitrophic arthropod communities associated with a particular plant species of the highly biodiverse tropical forests. Nevertheless, further replication of study sites is needed to strengthen the conclusion that forest fragmentation negatively affects arthropod assemblages.},

It is thus imperative for each study to include a wide range of plant and insect taxa, but this requirement has rarely been met because of logistical difficulties.
* 2A novel approach using mass insect collecting and rearing by parataxonomists was applied to study the use of 59 species, 39 genera and 18 families of woody plants by 58 588 individuals and 1010 species of leaf-chewing insects in a lowland rainforest.
* 3Most species had wide host plant ranges with reference to congeneric plants. The modal host range for a herbivore feeding on a particular genus (Ficus, Macaranga or Psychotria) included {\textgreater}90\% of congeneric species studied. Only 3·7\% of species feeding on these genera were monophagous.
* 4Most herbivores were specialized with respect to confamilial plant genera, with modal host range of 1 genus from 9 studied in Euphorbiaceae and 13 in Rubiaceae. This pattern was corroborated by modal host range of 1 plant family from 18 studied.
* 5Because of the overlap among the herbivore communities on congeneric plants, the total number of herbivores on speciose plant genera was relatively small. For example, although 336 species of leaf-chewers used the 13 study species of Ficus, the 35 additional Ficus species present locally would support only estimated 163 additional species.
* 6Since large genera constitute a significant proportion of tropical floras, these results have implications for regional estimates of herbivore species richness. Our estimate of 10·6–24·1 leaf-chewing species effectively specialized to a rainforest tree species is an order of magnitude lower than previously suggested.
* 7The number of new herbivore species (y) resulting from the addition of the xth plant species to the compound community (x = 1, 2, 3, ... , n where n is the total number of plants studied) can be described as y = cxk, where c and k are constants. k is a useful descriptor of similarity among herbivore communities from different hosts.},

These trees (belonging to approximately 200 species representing 38 plant families) ultimately gave rise to 334 species of cerambycids. One-quarter of these beetle species had not yet been described, and hundreds of previously unknown host-plant associations were documented. These data are presented in a table which also includes the results of additional rearing experiments in French Guiana, as well as selected literature references. Organized by host-tree family, the table facilitates the circumscription of beetle guilds occurring on related hosts. Abundantly represented plant families typically gave rise to faunas including numerous taxonomically unrelated beetles. The beetle guilds associated with different plant families had very different ratios of specialist:generalist species. The majority of the specialists successfully reproduced in related tree species belonging to a particular plant family; only a few cerambycid species appear to depend exclusively on a single host.

	abstract = {Mutualistic interaction networks have been shown to be structurally conserved over space and time while pairwise interactions show high variability. In such networks, modularity is the division of species into compartments, or modules, where species within modules share more interactions with each other than they do with species from other modules. Such a modular structure is common in mutualistic networks and several evolutionary and ecological mechanisms have been proposed as underlying drivers. One prominent explanation is the existence of pollination syndromes where flowers tend to attract certain pollinators as determined by a set of traits. We investigate the modularity of seven community level plant-pollinator networks sampled in rupestrian grasslands, or campos rupestres, in SE Brazil. Defining pollination systems as corresponding groups of flower syndromes and pollinator functional groups, we test the two hypotheses that (1) interacting species from the same pollination system are more often assigned to the same module than interacting species from different pollination systems and; that (2) interactions between species from the same pollination system are more consistent across space than interactions between species from different pollination systems. Specifically we ask (1) whether networks are consistently modular across space; (2) whether interactions among species of the same pollination system occur more often inside modules, compared to interactions among species of different pollination systems, and finally; (3) whether the spatial variation in interaction identity, i.e., spatial interaction rewiring, is affected by trait complementarity among species as indicated by pollination systems. We confirm that networks are consistently modular across space and that interactions within pollination systems principally occur inside modules. Despite a strong tendency, we did not find a significant effect of pollination systems on the spatial consistency of pairwise interactions. These results indicate that the spatial rewiring of interactions could be constrained by pollination systems, resulting in conserved network structures in spite of high variation in pairwise interactions. Our findings suggest a relevant role of pollination systems in structuring plant-pollinator networks and we argue that structural patterns at the sub-network level can help us to fully understand how and why interactions vary across space and time.},

	abstract = {Two decades of research have not established whether tropical insect herbivores are dominated by specialists or generalists. This impedes our understanding of species coexistence in diverse rainforest communities. Host specificity and species richness of tropical insects are also key parameters in mapping global patterns of biodiversity. Here we analyse data for over 900 herbivorous species feeding on 51 plant species in New Guinea and show that most herbivorous species feed on several closely related plant species. Because species-rich genera are dominant in tropical floras, monophagous herbivores are probably rare in tropical forests. Furthermore, even between phylogenetically distant hosts, herbivore communities typically shared a third of their species. These results do not support the classical view that the coexistence of herbivorous species in the tropics is a consequence of finely divided plant resources; non-equilibrium models of tropical diversity should instead be considered. Low host specificity of tropical herbivores reduces global estimates of arthropod diversity from 31 million (ref. 1) to 4–6 million species. This finding agrees with estimates based on taxonomic collections, reconciling an order of magnitude discrepancy between extrapolations of global diversity based on ecological samples of tropical communities with those based on sampling regional faunas.},

	abstract = {Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels—especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour—is essential for making the science predictive. ‘Pattern-oriented modelling’ (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.},

Accordingly, the structure and underlying mechanisms of individual-based interaction networks remain largely unknown.


* In a common garden, we recorded all interactions on flowers and leaves of 97 Sinapis arvensis individuals from seedling stage to fruit set and related interindividual differences in interactions to the plant individuals’ phenotypes.


* The plant individuals significantly differed in their quantitative and qualitative interactions with arthropods on flowers and leaves. These differences remained stable over the entire season and thus were time-invariant. Variation in interacting arthropod communities could be explained by a pronounced intraspecific variability in flowering phenology, morphology and flower scent, and translated into variation in reproductive success. Interestingly, plant individuals with a similar composition of flower visitors were also visited by a similar assemblage of interaction partners at leaves.


* Our results show that the nonuniformity of plant species has pronounced effects in community ecology, potentially with implications for the persistence of communities and populations, and their ability to withstand environmental fluctuations.},

	abstract = {The concept of pollination syndromes has been widely questioned, since plant–pollinator interactions have proved to be more generalist than was previously thought. We examined whether the network of a tropical high-altitude grassland contained groups of plants and pollinators that interact preferentially with each other. A general binary matrix was created. To assess the robustness of myophily, in all analyses we considered: 1) the whole network, 2) the network after the wasps were removed, and 3) the network after the flies were removed. For each network we evaluated whether: 1) the observed interactions were more related to syndromes than expected by chance, compared to an expected matrix; 2) there was a modular structure; 3) the modules found were more related to syndromes than expected by chance, compared to another expected matrix; 4) the syndromes were equally robust. For this analysis, the general matrix was subdivided into smaller matrices that included each pollination syndrome separately. To test the influence of the functional groups of pollinators and the phylogeny of plants, in addition to the general matrix, we also considered the first expected matrix, a quantitative functional group and a plant phylogeny matrix. The pollination syndromes determined the pattern of interactions in the network: 69\% of the total interactions resulted from the functional group of pollinators predicted by the plant syndrome. The network showed greater modularity (13 modules) than expected by chance, mostly consisting of the expected functional groups of pollinators and plant syndromes. The modules were associated with pollination syndromes more than was predicted by chance. Most of the variation in interactions was explained by functional groups of pollinators or by plant syndromes. Plant phylogeny did not account for a significant amount of variation in the interactions. Our findings support the concept of pollination syndromes. However, the interactions were not equally predicted by different pollination syndromes, and the accuracy of the prediction was strongest for ornithophily and melittophily.},

Using a food network of 900 native European butterfly and moth species and 1944 native plants, we built an herbivore host-use model. By extrapolating host use from the native herbivore–plant food network, we accurately forecasted the observed novel use of 459 non-native plant species by native herbivores. Patterns that governed herbivore host breadth on co-evolved native plants were equally important in determining non-native hosts. Our results make the forecasting of novel herbivore communities feasible in order to better understand the fate and impact of introduced plants.},

We studied phasmids and their food plants in a tropical lowland rain forest in Borneo (Danum Valley, Sabbah, Malaysia). Thirty species of phasmid were collected from 49 plant species during nocturnal surveys in the forest understorey. In most cases (35 plant species), experiments confirmed that these phasmids fed on those plant species from which they were collected. Partitioning of phasmid species among food plant species was highly significant. Two common species had a largely restricted diet: Asceles margaritatus occured mainly on Mallotus spp. (Euphorbiaceae) and Dinophasma ruficornis on Leea indica (Leeaceae). Other phasmids fed on a broad spectrum of plant families and can be considered polyphagous (e.g. Haaniella echinata, Lonchodes hosei herberti. Feeding experiments were performed on captive phasmids using leaves from eight plant species. Asceles margaritus showed a significantly higher consumption rate for Mallotus miquelianus leaves than for other plants, while H. echinata showed the opposite trend and the lowest consumption for M. miquelianus. However, A. margaritatus readily accepted foliage from several plant families, particularly when Mallotus was not offered at the same time. Therefore, studies on host specialisation by herbivores need to include their distribution in the natural vegetation.},

By classifying herbivores according to the degree of host plant specialization, we also investigated whether invasive grasses reduce the uniqueness of the herbivorous assemblages. Herbivorous insect richness showed a unimodal relationship with invasive grass cover that was significantly explained only by way of the variation in host plant richness. The same result was found for polyphagous and oligophagous insects, but monophages showed a significant negative response to the intensity of the grass invasion that was independent of host plant richness. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that the aggregate effect of invasive plants on herbivores tends to mirror the effects of invasive plants on host plants. In addition, exotic plants affect specialist insects differently from generalist insects; thus exotic plants affect not only the size but also the structural profile of herbivorous insect assemblages.},

The parasitoid communities of 16 chalcid wasps feeding on ten grass species were sampled between 1986 and 1989 at 4-11 sites per grass species in southwest Germany. The data were compared to published data from Great Britain, comprising 18 chalcid hosts on ten grass species sampled between 1980 and 1992 at 24 sites in Wales and England. Results showed that many conclusions drawn from patterns in Britain did not hold for Germany, emphasizing the need to repeat analyses in different geographical regions. The parasitoid communities of the Tetramesa hosts included on average 8.1 parasitoid species in Germany, while the British hosts supported only 4.1 parasitoids. The number of monophagous parasitoid species was similar in both areas (2.4 vs 3.2), but German host populations supported many more polyphagous species (5.1 vs 0.9). This difference reinforces the earlier conclusion that parasitoid communities in Britain are highly undersaturated. Increased numbers of parasitoid species in Germany did not result in increased parasitism rates, so the closer species packing was paralleled by reduced impact of each species. In Germany, percent parasitism (range: 5-74\%) was closely correlated with log host density, explaining 90\% of the variance, while in Great Britain, percent parasitism was less variable (range: 36-76\%) and was not related to host density or other host or host plant characteristics. Gallers and non-gallers supported equal numbers of parasitoids in both Germany and Britain, offering support for neither the enemy hypothesis of the adaptive nature of plant galls nor for the finding that galls are often more susceptible to enemy attack than their non-galling relatives. Furthermore, gregarious Tetramesa hosts were not attacked by more parasitoid species than solitary hosts.},

By standardizing sampling intensity and the phylogenetic diversity of focal plants, we are able to make the first rigorous and unbiased comparisons of specificity patterns across feeding guilds. 3. Specificity was highly variable among guilds, spanning almost the full range of theoretically possible values from extreme trophic generalization to monophagy. 4. We identify guilds of herbivores that are most likely to influence the composition of tropical forest vegetation through density-dependent herbivory or apparent competition. 5. We calculate that 251 herbivore species (48 of them unique) are associated with each rain forest tree species in our study site so that the ∼200 tree species coexisting in the lowland rain forest community are involved in ∼50 000 trophic interactions with ∼9600 herbivore species of insects.

	abstract = {Despite increasing knowledge about the effects of habitat loss on pollinators in natural landscapes, information is very limited regarding the underlying mechanisms of forest fragmentation affecting plant-pollinator interactions in such landscapes. Here, we used a network approach to describe the effects of forest fragmentation on the patterns of interactions involving the understory dominant palm Astrocaryum mexicanum (Arecaceae) and its floral visitors (including both effective and non-effective pollinators) at the individual level in a Mexican tropical rainforest landscape. Specifically, we asked: (i) Does fragment size affect the structure of individual-based plant-pollinator networks? (ii) Does the core of highly interacting visitor species change along the fragmentation size gradient? (iii) Does forest fragment size influence the abundance of effective pollinators of A. mexicanum? We found that fragment size did not affect the topological structure of the individual-based palm-pollinator network. Furthermore, while the composition of peripheral non-effective pollinators changed depending on fragment size, effective core generalist species of pollinators remained stable. We also observed that both abundance and variance of effective pollinators of male and female flowers of A. mexicanum increased with forest fragment size. These findings indicate that the presence of effective pollinators in the core of all forest fragments could keep the network structure stable along the gradient of forest fragmentation. In addition, pollination of A. mexicanum could be more effective in larger fragments, since the greater abundance of pollinators in these fragments may increase the amount of pollen and diversity of pollen donors between flowers of individual plants. Given the prevalence of fragmentation in tropical ecosystems, our results indicate that the current patterns of land use will have consequences on the underlying mechanisms of pollination in remnant forests.},

	abstract = {* Understanding the spatial scale of population structure is fundamental to long-standing tenets of population biology, landscape ecology and conservation. Nonetheless, identifying such scales has been challenging because a key factor that influences scaling – movement among patches or local populations – is a multicausal process with substantial phenotypic and temporal variation.


* We resolve this problem via a novel application of network modularity. When applied to movements, modularity provides a formal description of the functional aggregation of populations and identifies potentially critical scales for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We first test for modularity using several different types of biologically relevant movements across the entire geographic range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). We then ask whether variation in movement based on (i) age, (ii) sex and (iii) time (annual, seasonal and within-season movements) influences spatial population structure (i.e. modularity) in snail kites.


* We identified significant modularity in annual dispersal of snail kites (all adults, males only, females only, and juveniles only) and in within-breeding season movements of adults, yet no evidence of modularity in seasonal (non-breeding) movements. For those movements with observed modular structure, we found striking similarities in the spatial configuration of population structure, even though movement properties varied considerably among these different types of movements.


* Our results suggest that the emergence of modularity in population networks can be robust despite movement heterogeneity and differences in patch-based measures of connectivity. Furthermore, our comparison of the population structure and connectivity across multiple movement phases helps to identify wetland patches most critical to population connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales.


* We argue that understanding modularity in populations may provide a robust complement to existing measures of population structure and connectivity and will help to clarify the limiting roles of movement for populations. Such information is increasingly needed for interpreting population persistence and guiding effective conservation strategies with ongoing environmental change.},

	abstract = {Understanding variation in resource specialization is important for progress on issues that include coevolution, community assembly, ecosystem processes, and the latitudinal gradient of species richness. Herbivorous insects are useful models for studying resource specialization, and the interaction between plants and herbivorous insects is one of the most common and consequential ecological associations on the planet. However, uncertainty persists regarding fundamental features of herbivore diet breadth, including its relationship to latitude and plant species richness. Here, we use a global dataset to investigate host range for over 7,500 insect herbivore species covering a wide taxonomic breadth and interacting with more than 2,000 species of plants in 165 families. We ask whether relatively specialized and generalized herbivores represent a dichotomy rather than a continuum from few to many host families and species attacked and whether diet breadth changes with increasing plant species richness toward the tropics. Across geographic regions and taxonomic subsets of the data, we find that the distribution of diet breadth is fit well by a discrete, truncated Pareto power law characterized by the predominance of specialized herbivores and a long, thin tail of more generalized species. Both the taxonomic and phylogenetic distributions of diet breadth shift globally with latitude, consistent with a higher frequency of specialized insects in tropical regions. We also find that more diverse lineages of plants support assemblages of relatively more specialized herbivores and that the global distribution of plant diversity contributes to but does not fully explain the latitudinal gradient in insect herbivore specialization.},

	abstract = {(1) The deciduous forests and the riparian evergreen vegetation that they include in the lowlands of Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, contain at least 975 species of dicotyledonous plants. At least 110 species of beetles (Coleoptera) whose larvae are seed-predators were reared from more than 3700 samples of fruits and seeds of these plants. (2) At least 100 species of these plants usually had beetle seed-predators (Bruchidae, Curculionidae, Cerambycidae) in their mature or nearly mature fruits or seeds. (3) Most (75\%) of the species of beetles were specific to a particular plant species; 14 preyed on two plant species, 9 on three, and 2 on four. The bruchid Stator pruininus preyed on six species and S. limbatus on eight species. (4) Of the 100 species of plants whose seeds were preyed on regularly by beetles, 63 were in the Leguminosae, 11 in the Convolvulaceae, and the remainder were spread among sixteen other plant families. (5) Of these 100 prey species, 59 were fed on by a single species of beetle, 25 by two species of beetles, 11 by three, 4 by four and one, Cassia leptocarpa, by five species of beetles. (6) In at least 90\% of seed or fruit samples, all species of beetles attacking that species in the study area were present. Of the 100 species of beetles, eighty were found in the first sample of the appropriate fruit or seeds. The prey of ten additional species of Bruchidae in the study area is unknown, but will be other than the prey species listed here. (7) With some striking exceptions, the prey species of those beetle species which preyed on more than one plant species were closely related. In contrast, in those cases where there were two or more congeneric plant species in the study area, the species of beetle which attacked one or more of them left unattacked an average of 5.8 of the congeneric plant species. (8) There were five unambiguous cases of a prey species that occurred throughout the study area and that had two or more species of beetle seed-predator whose distributions did not overlap at all. (9) Hymenopterous parasitoids were uncommon in most of the samples and were absent from large samples of a number of common tree species whose seeds were heavily preyed on by beetles. Of the 157 predator-prey pairs reported here, 57\% of the beetle species were unattacked by hymenopterous parasitoids. (10) The distribution of beetle predator species among the plant prey-species was conspicuously neither random nor uniform. Unexpectedly large numbers of species were either unattacked, or preyed on by two to five species of beetles, while unexpectedly small numbers were attacked by a single species of beetle. (11) The prey-specificity of most of these seed-predators in a species-rich flora is of great importance in understanding the potential impact of animals on plant species-richness, but is not proof that seed predation by animals causes extreme plant species-richness. Furthermore, these beetles are only a small fraction of the animals that kill or weaken plants in a manner that may influence their abundance and spatial distribution.},

	abstract = {Aim  Theory suggests that introduced species that are phylogenetically distant from their recipient communities should be more successful than closely related introduced species because they can exploit open niches and escape enemies in their new range, i.e. Darwin’s Naturalization Hypothesis. Alternatively, it has also been hypothesized that closely related invaders might be more successful than novel invaders because they are pre-adapted to conditions in their new range; a paradox coined Darwin’s Naturalization Conundrum. To date, these hypotheses have been tested primarily at the regional scale, not within local plant communities where introduced species colonize, compete and encounter herbivores. Location  Global. Methods and Results  We used community phylogenetics to analyse data from 49 published experiments to examine the importance of phylogenetic relatedness and generalist herbivory on native and exotic plant success at the community level. Plants that were categorized as ‘invasive’ were indeed less related to the recipient community than ‘non-pest’ exotic plants. Distantly related exotic plants were also more abundant than closely related species. Phylogenetic relatedness predicted herbivore impact, but in a way that was opposite to predictions, as herbivores had stronger, not lesser, impacts on distantly related plants. Importantly, these same patterns generally held for native plants, as distantly related native plants were more abundant and more susceptible to herbivores than closely related species, ultimately resulting in herbivores suppressing community-level phylogenetic diversity. Main conclusions  Distantly related plants were more locally successful despite experiencing stronger control by generalist herbivores, a finding that was robust across native and exotic species. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that phylogenetic matching influences the local success of both native and exotic species and that herbivores can influence community phylodiversity. Phylogenetic relatedness explained a relatively small portion of the variance in the data even after taking herbivory into account, however, suggesting that phylogenetic matching works in combination with other factors to influence community assembly.},

We find that AF reverses negative effects of nestedness and positive effects of connectance on the stability of the networks by partitioning the niches among species within guilds. This behaviour enables generalist pollinators to preferentially forage on the most specialised of their plant partners which increases the pollination services to specialist plants and cedes the resources of generalist plants to specialist pollinators. We corroborate these behavioural preferences with intensive field observations of bee foraging. Our results show that incorporating key organismal behaviours with well-known biological mechanisms such as consumer-resource interactions into the analysis of ecological networks may greatly improve our understanding of complex ecosystems.},

Summary

Most spermatophytes need conspecific pollen in order to produce seed. This need for specialization seems to conflict with the generalized nature of most plant–pollinator interactions. Specialization and generalization are dynamic – not fixed – and exist simultaneously in multiple states at different levels of biological hierarchy. Over the short term, specialization ensures conspecific pollen transfer, whereas over the long term, generalization improves system-level robustness. The balance between specialization and generalization at different scales is critical for different kinds of ecological functioning and is an important factor in plant speciation and the evolution of plant mating systems. Community context, including diversity and interaction network structure at different levels of aggregation, is a key driver of specialization dynamics.},

	abstract = {Background and aims Colour is one of the main floral traits used by pollinators to locate flowers. Although pollinators show innate colour preferences, the view that the colour of a flower may be considered an important predictor of its main pollinators is highly controversial because flower choice is highly context-dependent, and initial innate preferences may be overridden by subsequent associative learning. Our objective is to establish whether there is a relationship between flower colour and pollinator composition in natural communities.
Methods We measured the flower reflectance spectrum and pollinator composition in four plant communities (85 plant species represented by 109 populations, and 32 305 plant–pollinator interactions in total). Pollinators were divided into six taxonomic groups: bees, ants, wasps, coleopterans, dipterans and lepidopterans.
Key Results We found consistent associations between pollinator groups and certain colours. These associations matched innate preferences experimentally established for several pollinators and predictions of the pollination syndrome theory. However, flowers with similar colours did not attract similar pollinator assemblages.
Conclusions The explanation for this paradoxical result is that most flower species are pollination generalists. We conclude that although pollinator colour preferences seem to condition plant–pollinator interactions, the selective force behind these preferences has not been strong enough to mediate the appearance and maintenance of tight colour-based plant–pollinator associations.},

	abstract = {Pollination network studies are based on pollinator surveys conducted on focal plants. This plant-centred approach provides insufficient information on flower visitation habits of rare pollinator species, which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result, pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant–pollinator interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive field survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators. We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very significant number of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes. Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5 to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant–pollinator networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species, and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization. However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased. The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly defined modules that were not apparent when only field survey data were used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion of connector links and species. That is, although significant, the four modules were far from isolated.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly aware of the interplay between evolutionary history and ecological processes in shaping current species interaction patterns. The inclusion of phylogenetic relationships in studies of species interaction networks has shown that closely related species commonly interact with sets of similar species. Notably, the degree of phylogenetic conservatism in antagonistic ecological interactions is frequently stronger among species at lower trophic levels than among those at higher trophic levels. One hypothesis that accounts for this asymmetry is that competition among consumer species promotes resource partitioning and offsets the maintenance of dietary similarity by phylogenetic inertia. Here, we used a regional plant–herbivore network comprised of Asteraceae species and flower-head endophagous insects to evaluate how the strength of phylogenetic conservatism in species interactions differs between the two trophic levels. We also addressed whether the asymmetry in the strength of the phylogenetic signal between plants and animals depends on the overall degree of relatedness among the herbivores. We show that, beyond the previously reported compositional similarity, closely related species also share a greater proportion of counterpart phylogenetic history, both for resource and consumer species. Comparison of the patterns found in the entire network with those found in subnetworks composed of more phylogenetically restricted groups of herbivores provides evidence that resource partitioning occurs mostly at deeper phylogenetic levels, so that a positive phylogenetic signal in antagonist similarity is detectable even between closely related consumers in monophyletic subnetworks. The asymmetry in signal strength between trophic levels is most apparent in the way network modules reflect resource phylogeny, both for the entire network and for subnetworks. Taken together, these results suggest that evolutionary processes, such as phylogenetic conservatism and independent colonization history of the insect groups may be the main forces generating the phylogenetic structure observed in this particular plant–herbivore network system.},

* 3The summary food web, containing data for the whole year, is we believe the most diverse quantitative host–parasitoid web yet described. It contains 93 species of leaf-miner, 84 species of parasitoid and 196 links between hosts and parasitoids.
* 4Most parasitoids were generalists, with individual parasitoid species recorded as parasitizing up to 21 host species. In contrast, most leaf-miners were specialists, with 114 links documented between leaf-miners and their host plants.
* 5A robustness analysis was used to reveal the effects of different sampling intensities on food web statistics. The results suggest that the sampling had revealed most of the species of host and parasitoid in the community, but further interactions among species would continue to be detected with additional sampling. Measures of the ratio of hosts to parasitoids and of realized connectance were relatively insensitive to sampling intensity.
* 6Three seasonal webs were constructed, revealing temporal changes in the structure of the community. There was greater turnover in host species composition than parasitoid species composition among seasons, but most web statistics remained relatively constant across seasons.
* 7Both the summary web and the seasonal webs show low levels of compartmentalization, suggesting that the host–parasitoid community is not divided into relatively discrete subwebs with largely independent dynamics.
* 8The extent of potential indirect interactions between pairs of hosts was assessed by constructing quantitative parasitoid overlap graphs. These suggest that abundant species are likely to have greater indirect effects on less abundant species than vice versa , and that species in the same taxonomic order are more likely to interact indirectly. The graphs do not support the hypothesis that species sharing the same host plant are more likely to interact via shared parasitoids.},

The parasitoid assemblages associated with 18 species of chalcid wasps feeding on 10 grass species were sampled quantitatively between 1980 and 1992 at 24 sites in Wales and England to examine food web structure, the size and composition of the parasitoid complexes, and structures of the local communities. 2. The complete food web included 87 species organized into five trophic levels. The lower two consumer trophic levels (the herbivores and primary parasitoids) were characterized by extreme host specificity, whereas the top two trophic levels (hyperparasitoids and tertiary parasitoids) comprised more generalized omnivores. The high levels of specialization resulted in a compartmentalized web. 3. The regional species richness of the parasitoid complexes associated with Tetramesa species (Eurytomidae) depends primarily on measures of host abundance. Total species richness was significantly positively correlated with mean log host density (number per m2) and the number of larvae per grass stem, explaining 70.5\% of the variance in richness. Similarly, the number of specialist parasitoids was correlated with host density, whereas generalist species richness was most strongly correlated with host density and more weakly with host gall-formation and voltinism. 4. The only determinant of local parasitoid species richness is regional richness (the latter explained 97.3\% of the variance in the former). Further, there was no beta -diversity in this food web, and every species found on a host species in Britain is found in virtually every local host population. The relatively few cases where fewer parasitoid species were found represent undersampling at particular sites. Limited evidence indicates that similar results apply to host populations on continental Europe. Thus, there is no evidence that the richness of local communities is constrained by species interactions. 5. Variation in parasitism rates both between and within host species cannot be explained by the available variables, so the forces affecting host utilization rates remain unknown. We found that the formation of a gall had no influence on host mortality rates, offering no support for the hypothesis that galling provides protection from parasitoids. 6. The parasitoids of most host species have consistent relative abundances over time and space. We could not identify any ecological correlates of the degree of consistency, but it may be due to the extremely widespread occurrence of all of the parasitoids coupled with their innate host-finding abilities.},

In a tropical lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia, these trees produced seeds irregularly but intensely during general flowering and seeding events in 1996 and/or 1998. Dipterocarp seeds were preyed on by 51 insect species (11 families), which were roughly classified into three taxonomic groups: smaller moths (Tortricidae, Pyralidae, Crambidae, Immidae, Sesiidae and Cosmopterigidae), scolytids (Scolytidae) and weevils (Curculionidae, Apionidae, Anthribidae, and Attelabidae). Although the host-specificity of invertebrate seed predators has been assumed to be high in tropical forests, it was found that the diet ranges of some insect predators were relatively wide and overlapped one another. Most seed predators that were collected in both study years changed their diets between general flowering and seeding events. The results of cluster analyses, based on the number of adults of each predator species that emerged from 100 seeds of each tree species, suggested that the dominant species was not consistent, alternating between the two years.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  1. The ways in which a soil fertility gradient affects three trophic level food webs defined by plants of the family Asteraceae, flower-head herbivores, and their parasitoids was investigated. It was tested how the fertility gradient alters: (i) the abundance and richness of plants, herbivores, and their parasitoids, (ii) the herbivore–plant ratio, and (iii) the connectance of the plant–herbivore community matrix. 2. From April to May 2000, plants and insects were sampled in 16 Brazilian Cerrado (sensu stricto) sites along a physiognomic gradient varying from open shrublands (cerrado) to closed woodlands (cerradão). Sites were objectively positioned along the physiognomic gradient by a single index, tree density. Sixty-seven per cent of the variation in tree density among sites was correlated to two principal components of a PCA, representing gradients of soil fertility. 3. Asteraceae abundance, richness, and flower-head availability were negatively related to tree density due to their preference for sunny environments, despite the surplus of soil nutrients. The abundance and richness of Diptera and Lepidoptera, the most important flower-head herbivores, were also negatively related to tree density. Parasitoid abundance decreased with tree density; however, the number of parasitoids per hosts was lower in cerrado, suggesting that top-down forces are not getting stronger in more productive sites, as could be expected. 4. Community allometry analyses showed that the herbivore to plant ratio was independent of community richness and did not respond to tree density. 5. Connectance of the plant–herbivore matrix was dependent on the community matrix size. Proportionally, species-rich cerrado sites had fewer interactions than their species-poor counterparts. Nevertheless, after removing the effect of the matrix size, connectance was not related to tree density. 6. Soil fertility, as the primary cause of the cerrado–cerradão physiognomic gradient, strongly affected the abundance and richness of plants, herbivores and their parasitoids; however, it had little effect on important community attributes, such as the herbivore–plant ratio and the connectance of the plant–herbivore matrix.},

	abstract = {Despite recent findings on the ecological relevance of within population diet variation far less attention has been devoted to the role diet variation for ecological services. Seed dispersal is a key ecological service, affecting plant fitness and regeneration based on foraging by fruit-eating vertebrates. Here we used a network approach, widely used to understand how seed-dispersal is organized at the species level, to gain insights into the patterns that emerge at the individual-level. We studied the individual fruit consumption behavior of a South American didelphid Didelphis albiventris, during the cool–dry and warm–wet seasons. In species–species networks the heterogeneity in specialization levels generates patterns such as nestedness and asymmetry. Because generalist populations may be comprised of specialized individuals, we hypo thesized that network structural properties, such as nestedness, should also emerge at the individual level. We detected variation in fruit consumption that was not related to resource availability, ontogenetic or sexual factors or sampling biases. Such variation resulted in the structural patterns often found in species–species seed-dispersal networks: low connectance, a high degree of nestedness and the absence of modules. Moreover structure varied between the warm–wet and cool–dry seasons, presumably as a consequence of seasonal fluctuation in fruit availability. Our findings suggest individuals may differ in selectivity causing asymmetries in seed dispersal efficiency within the population. In this sense the realized dispersal would differ from the expected dispersal estimated from their average dispersal potential. Additionally the results suggest possible frequency-dependent effects on seed dispersal that might affect individual plant performance and plant community composition.},

Our results support the syndrome concept, indicating that convergent floral evolution is driven by adaptation to the most effective pollinator group. The predictability of pollination syndromes is greater in pollinator-dependent species and in plants from tropical regions. Many plant species also have secondary pollinators that generally correspond to the ancestral pollinators documented in evolutionary studies.

Whether the plant is a weed, an ornamental, or a crop, the development versus non-development of a novel plant–insect interaction can have profound effects for both economic and conservation applications. In this paper, we sketch mechanistic and statistical frameworks for predicting these interactions, based on how plant and herbivore traits as well as shared evolutionary history can influence detection, recognition, and digestion of novel plants. By emphasizing mechanisms at each of these steps, we hope to clarify different aspects of novel interactions and why they may or may not occur. We also emphasize prediction and forecasting, as a major goal is to know in advance which interactions will develop from the many plant or insect introductions that occur in natural and man-made systems.},

This ignorance limits evaluation of species extinction patterns following various deforestation scenarios. We studied leaf-chewing insects feeding on 59 species of woody plants from 39 genera and 18 families in a lowland rainforest in Papua New Guinea and surveyed all plants with a stem diameter at breast height of ≥5 cm in a 1-ha plot within the same area. We used two extrapolation methods, based on randomized species-accumulation curves, to combine these two data sets and estimate the number of species of leaf-chewing herbivores feeding on woody plants from the 1-ha area. We recorded 58,483 feeding individuals from 940 species of leaf-chewing insects. The extrapolation estimated that there were 1567–2559 species of leaf-chewing herbivores feeding on the 152 plant species from 97 genera and 45 families found in 1 ha of the forest. Most of the herbivore diversity was associated with plant diversity on the familial and generic levels. We predicted that, on average, the selection of 45 plant species each representing a different family supported 39\% of all herbivore species, the 52 plant species each representing a different additional genus from these families supported another 39\% of herbivore species, and the remaining 55 plant species from these genera supported 22\% of herbivore species. Lepidoptera was the most speciose taxon in the local fauna, followed by Coleoptera and orthopteroids (Orthoptera and Phasmatodea). The ratio of herbivore to plant species and the estimated relative species richness of the Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and orthopteroids remained constant on the spatial scale from 0.25 to 1 ha. However, the utility of local taxon-to-taxon species ratios for extrapolations to geographic scales requires further study.},

We examined the distribution of insect herbivore associations with respect to host plant phylogeny for caterpillars (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and grasshoppers and relatives (orthopteroids) in a New Guinea rain forest. We collected herbivores from three lineages of closely related woody plants and from more distantly related plant lineages in the same locality to examine the phylogenetic scale at which host specificity can be detected in a community sample. By grafting molecular phylogenies inferred from three different genes into a supertree, we developed a phylogenetic hypothesis for the host community. Feeding experiments were performed on more than 100 000 live insects collected from the 62 host species. We examined patterns of host use with respect to the host plant phylogeny. As predicted, we found a negative relationship between faunal similarity, defined as the proportion of all herbivores feeding on two hosts that are shared between the hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between hosts based on DNA sequence divergence. Host phylogenetic distance explained a significant fraction of the variance (25\%) in herbivore community similarity, in spite of the many ecological factors that probably influence feeding patterns. Herbivore community similarity among congeneric hosts was high (50\% on average) compared to overlap among host families (20–30\% on average). We confirmed this pattern using the nearest taxon index (NTI) and net relatedness index (NRI) to quantify the extent of phylogenetic clustering in particular herbivore associations and to test whether patterns are significantly different from chance expectations. We found that 40\% of caterpillar species showed significant phylogenetic clustering with respect to host plant associations, somewhat more so than for beetles or orthopteroids. We interpret this as evidence that a substantial fraction of tropical forest insect herbivores are clade specialists.},

A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m−2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.},

For this we used network analysis to evaluate the impact of fragmentation on howler population traits and on resource availability and food choice. A total of 37 tree and liana species and seven plant items (bark, immature fruits, flowers, mature fruits, immature leaves, mature leaves and petioles) were consumed, but their relative consumption varied according to sex and age classes and habitat type. Overall, adult females consumed the greatest number of plant species and items while infants and juveniles the lowest. For both continuous and fragmented forests, we found a nested diet for howler monkey-plant networks: diets of more selective monkeys represent subsets of the diets of other individuals. Nestedness was likely due to the high selectivity of early life stages in specific food plants and items, which contrasts with the generalized foraging behaviour of adults. Information on the extent to which different plant species and primate populations depend on such interactions in different habitats will help to make accurate predictions about the potential impact of disturbances on plant-animal interaction networks.},

Further, we reared 106 species from larvae sampled on 14 plant species. Both xylem- and phloem-feeding guilds exhibited wide host-plant ranges, as 74\% of species fed on more than one plant family. In comparison, using data extracted from the temperate-zone literature, phloem-feeders exhibited lower host specificity in Papua New Guinea than in Germany, because in Papua New Guinea they were dominated by generalist Fulgoroidea while in Germany by specialist Membracoidea. The similarity of Auchenorrhyncha assemblages from different plant species was unrelated to the phylogenetic distance between their hosts. Host specificity, abundance and species composition of Auchenorrhyncha assemblages were unrelated to the optimum of their host plant species on succession gradient from secondary to primary forest. Higher host specificity did not lead to greater species richness in Auchenorrhyncha assemblages feeding on different plant species, but the number of species feeding on a particular plant species was a strong predictor of the Auchenorrhyncha abundance on that plant. These patterns suggest that Auchenorrhyncha assemblages on these plant species are not saturated with species and determined by division of limited resources among competitors, but instead are dependent on the number of colonizers from the regional species pool.},

	abstract = {* 1Compartmentation has been less explored than other forms of community structure. We assessed compartmentation of associations between insects and plants on a regional scale, and analysed some of its causes and consequences. The data set used was the host records of fruit flies (Diptera; Tephritidae) that breed in flowerheads of plants of the tribe Vernonieae (Asteraceae) in the Espinhaço Mountain range, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This data set was obtained with a consistent sampling protocol and is taxonomically fully resolved.
* 2The binary association matrix had a total of 35 insect and 81 plant species. Most of the insects were specialized on plants of a single subtribe, genus or species group. Correspondence analysis showed that the association matrix is divided in six well-delimited compartments of insects specialized on subtribes or genera of plants.
* 3Host dissimilarity among insects and insect dissimilarity among plants were expressed as Jaccard distances. Tests with a multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) showed that both kinds of dissimilarities were higher among compartments than within them.
* 4Monte Carlo randomizations were used to compare matrix parameters with values expected in the absence of compartments. In 4000 runs, the number of insect species that shared at least one host plant (ecological neighbours) was smaller than expected. Nevertheless, mean host similarity among insects, and the proportion of exclusive host plants used by each insect species did not differ from null model predictions. Host similarity of insects with their nearest neighbours in niche space was higher than expected by the null model. On the other hand, host similarity with farthest neighbours was lower than expected.
* 6The observed compartmentation of insect/plant associations can be ascribed to the marked specialization of flowerhead tephritids, and allows the reduction of diffuse competition among insects. However, compartmentation did not decrease overall niche overlap among insects because reduction in number of neighbours is offset by increased overlap with species in the same compartment. Therefore, the pattern in this system cannot be derived from resource partitioning alone.},

Historically there are two basic ways to construct an IN: binary networks (BN) that represent unweighted links among species in the web, and weighted networks (WN) that weight each interaction among species by its relative or absolute frequency in the web. We call binary reduction the transition from WN to BN which obviously entails loss of information. We performed an analysis with 69 WN on which we worked the binary reduction. For both WN and BN we computed: the coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, Shannon entropy and the Gini coefficient on the population statistics. We also computed the dependence asymmetry, the pairwise Jaccard distance and two different measures of nestedness, (W)NODF and τ-temperature, for the WN and BN. From correlations between the values for WN and BN we concluded that, for most of the indices, the loss of information due to the binary reduction is not significant. Using a statistical evaluation, for most indices, BN give similar results to their corresponding WN.},

	abstract = {A survey of 85 species of Lepidoptera feeding on 40 hosts on Barro Colorado Island, Panama showed that growth and defensive traits of caterpillars were correlated with the nutritional and defensive traits of their hosts. Growth rates were faster on young than mature leaves, reflecting the higher nitrogen and water content of the former. Growth was also positively correlated with leaf expansion rate, partially because of higher nitrogen and water contents of fast-expanding young leaves. Specialists grew faster than generalists, but both responded positively to nutritional quality. There was no effect of lepidopteran family on growth. In analyses where the effects of nitrogen and water were removed, the residuals for growth rate were greater for young than for mature leaves and were positively correlated with expansion rates of young leaves. This suggests that traits other than nutrition were also important. As young, expanding leaves cannot use toughness as a defense, one possible explanation for the differences in growth is differences in chemical defenses. Growth rate residuals for both specialists and generalists were higher for the more poorly defended fast-expanders, but the effect was greatest for generalists, perhaps because generalists were more sensitive to secondary metabolites. We predicted that slow growth for caterpillars would increase their risk to natural enemies and would select for higher defenses. Generalists had more defensive traits than specialists and were less preferred in feeding trials with ants. Similarly, species feeding on mature leaves were the most defended and those feeding on fast-expanding young leaves were the least defended and most preferred by ants. Thus the effects of plant secondary metabolites and nutrients dictate herbivore growth rates, which in turn influence their susceptibility to the third trophic level and the importance of defenses.},

We combine this empirical work with a simulation experiment designed to further investigate how variation among individual tree genotypes can impact network structure. Three findings emerged: (1) the empirical “genotype–species network” exhibited significant network structure with modularity being greater than the highly conservative null model; (2) as would be expected given a modular network structure, the empirical network displayed significant positive arthropod co-occurrence patterns; and (3) furthermore, the simulations of “genotype–species” networks displayed variation in network structure, with modularity in particular clearly increasing, as genotypic variation increased. These results support the conclusion that genetic variation in a single species contributes to the structure of ecological interaction networks, which could influence ecological dynamics (e.g., assembly and stability) and evolution in a community context.},

Abstract
Hosts belonging to the same species suffer dramatically different impacts from their natural enemies. This has been explained by host neighbourhood, that is, by surrounding host-species diversity or spatial separation between hosts. However, even spatially neighbouring hosts may be separated by many million years of evolutionary history, potentially reducing the establishment of natural enemies and their impact. We tested whether phylogenetic isolation of oak hosts from neighbouring trees within a forest canopy reduces phytophagy. We found that an increase in phylogenetic isolation by 100 million years corresponded to a 10-fold decline in phytophagy. This was not due to poorer living conditions for phytophages on phylogenetically isolated oaks. Neither species diversity of neighbouring trees nor spatial distance to the closest oak affected phytophagy. We suggest that reduced pressure by natural enemies is a major advantage for individuals within a host species that leave their ancestral niche and grow among distantly related species.},

By contrast, how variation in prey biological traits may affect niche width and partitioning is still a poorly explored topic. One of these candidate traits is prey mobility, which can affect the predators’ niche because acting on the rate of encounter and, assuming mobility as a proxy for escape capability, on the success of predator attacks. Here we analysed 20 wasp populations and their prey as individual-based food-webs to test if prey mobility may explain niche width (here defined by the Shannon entropy-based index ) and patterns of inter-individual diet variation (here defined by the interaction-exclusiveness index H2′ and the interaction evenness index E2). Niche width was very variable among populations and overall network specialization (H2′) was always higher than the expected by null models. In case of high-speed flying prey (e.g. flies, bees), wasps showed wider niches () and lower specialization (H2′) than in case of non-flying or slow-flying prey (e.g. spiders, beetles). Evenness (E2), on the other side, did not vary with prey mobility. Altogether, these results suggest that highly elusive prey may lead to wider predators’ niche but somehow limit their individual niche specialization.},

Interaction strengths in turn influence the fate of pairwise interacting populations and the stability of food webs. Understanding the mechanisms relating individual phenotypic variation to interaction strengths is thus central to assess how trait variation affects population and community dynamics. We incorporated nonheritable variation in attack rates and handling times into a classical consumer–resource model to investigate how variation may alter interaction strengths, population dynamics, species persistence, and invasiveness. We found that individual variation influences species persistence through its effect on interaction strengths. In many scenarios, interaction strengths decrease with variation, which in turn affects species coexistence and stability. Because environmental change alters the direction and strength of selection acting upon phenotypic traits, our results have implications for species coexistence in a context of habitat fragmentation, climate change, and the arrival of exotic species to native ecosystems.},

However, as reviewed here, the concept ‘plant–pollinator specialization’ has multiple definitions and uses, and these disparate uses have engendered confusion in the literature. Organizing these disparate uses into a comprehensive framework is an overdue task, prior efforts notwithstanding.


* This contribution attempts to make clear the variation in meaning and usage of plant–pollinator specialization, including distinguishing between ecological specialization (interacting with few partners or resources), evolutionary specialization (genetic change associated with increased specialization) and phenotypic specialization (having specialized or derived phenotypic traits), with application of all three concepts to both plants and flower-visiting animals. These variations in interpretation of specialization affect how we view evolutionary and biogeographical trends, as well as extinction risk.


* In the light of this conceptual diversity, I evaluate the relationships between specialization and possible trends in floral evolution and rates of speciation and extinction. I also address several implications of specialization for community ecology and resilience of pollination services in the face of environmental disturbance.

If two species possess similar floral traits that determine shared flower visitors, floral traits can be said to mediate plant–plant interactions. Such indirect interactions are important for understanding fundamental relationships of plant communities, such as competition and facilitation but thus far have only been tested within a native community context.

* We test whether floral-trait similarity can be used to predict interactions between an invasive plant and co-occurring native species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We surveyed flower visitation at invaded and uninvaded plots across four sites and correlated floral-trait similarity between invasive and native species with both invasion impact on native flower visitation and flower visitor overlap of natives and the invasive species.

* Similarity of all traits (categorical and continuous) and categorical traits alone explained invasion impact (flower visitor overlap) between the native and invasive species. The majority of flower visitor overlap was attributed to the native honeybee Apis mellifera subsp. capensis.

* This study is the first to show that floral traits can be used to predict novel plant–plant interactions, even amongst ecologically generalized flower visitors and plants and to predict potential impacts of an invasive species on native flowering communities. However, floral traits were not useful for predicting changes in visitation to plant species.

* Synthesis. Results advance our understanding of the role of plant traits in ecological communities and reveal that they are important in mediating not only plant–pollinator interactions but also plant–plant interactions. Our findings also shed light on invasive–native plant interactions via pollinators and have the potential to predict certain invasion impacts.},

	abstract = {* Plant–insect food webs tend to be dominated by interactions resulting from diffuse co-evolution between plants and multiple lineages of herbivores rather than by reciprocal co-evolution and co-cladogenesis. Plants therefore require defence strategies effective against a broad range of herbivore species. In one extreme, plants could develop a single universal defence effective against all herbivorous insects, or tailor-made strategies for each herbivore species. The evolution and ecology of plant defence has to be studied with entire insect assemblages, rather than small subsets of pairwise interactions.


* The present study examines whether specialists and generalists in three coexisting insect lineages, forming the leaf-chewing guild, respond uniformly to plant phylogeny, secondary metabolites, nutrient content and mechanical antiherbivore defences of their hosts, thus permitting universal plant defence strategies against specialized and generalist folivorous insects from various taxa.


* The extensive data on folivorous assemblages comprising three insect orders and 193 species are linked with plant phylogeny, secondary chemistry (salicylates, flavonoids and tannins), leaf morphological traits [specific leaf area (SLA) and trichome coverage], nutrient (C : N) content and growth form of eight willow (Salix) and one aspen (Populus) species growing in sympatry.


* Generalists responded to overall host plant chemistry and trichomes, whilst specialists responded to host plant phylogeny and secondary metabolites that are unique to willows and that are capable of being utilized as an antipredator protection. We did not find any significant impact of other plant traits, that is SLA, C : N ratio, flavonoids, tannins and growth form, on the composition of leaf-chewing communities.


* Our results show that the response to plant traits is differential among specialists and generalists. This finding constrains the ability of plants to develop defensive traits universally effective against herbivores and may lead to diversification of plant defensive mechanisms into several complementary syndromes, required for effective protection against generalists and specialists from multiple insect taxa comprising most leaf-chewing assemblages. These results point to the necessity of broad studies of plant–herbivore interactions, across multiple insect taxa and guilds.},

We surveyed 15 leaf traits and patterns of chewing, mining, and galling herbivory in a common garden of 17 artificially crossed hybrid oak species and each of their parental species over a 2-year period. Using a phylogeny of oaks, we tested whether hybrids that resulted from more divergent parents received more herbivory than those derived from closely related parents (as would be predicted by a build-up of incompatibilities in defensive systems over evolutionary time) and found only marginal evidence in support of this. We found that chewing damage to hybrids was weakly predicted by the relatedness of a parental species to the single native oak. The levels of chewing and mining herbivory on hybrids were typically intermediate to those of their parental species, though less than the parental mean for chewing damage in 2008. Most leaf traits of hybrids were also intermediate to those of their parental species. There was no clear pattern in terms of an association between 11 species of cynipid gall wasps and hybrids. The patterns of (1) intermediate levels of herbivory on hybrids and (2) no trend in herbivory on hybrids based on the phylogenetic relatedness of parental species suggest that herbivory may not play a general role in limiting hybrid fitness (and thus gene-flow through hybrids) in oaks.},

These changes have the potential to affect seedling survival in logged forest and may alter forest composition and diversity.  Methodology/Principal Findings We manipulated seed density in plots beneath con- and heterospecific adult trees within a logged forest and excluded vertebrate predators of different body sizes using cages. We show that small and large-bodied predators differed in their effect on con- and heterospecific seedling mortality. In combination small and large-bodied predators dramatically decreased both con- and heterospecific seedling survival. In contrast, when larger-bodied predators were excluded small-bodied predators reduced conspecific seed survival leaving seeds coming from the distant tree of a different species.  Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that seed survival is affected differently by vertebrate predators according to their body size. Therefore, changes in the body size structure of the seed predator community in logged forests may change patterns of seed mortality and potentially affect recruitment and community composition.},

In 120 transects of 30 by 5 m (60 in deciduous forest and 60 in riparian habitats), 29 galling insects species were found and represented in the following order: Diptera (Cecidomyiidae, which induced the greatest abundance of galls with 22 species; 76\%), Homoptera (Psylloidea, 6.9\%; Psyllidae, 6.9\%; Triozidae, 3.4\%), Hymenoptera (Tanaostigmatidae, 3.4\%; which were rare), and one unidentified morphospecies (3.4\%). In all cases, there was a great specificity between galling insect species and their host plant species; one galling insect species was associated with one specific plant species. In contrast, there was no specificity between parasitoid species and their host galling insect species. Only 11 species of parasitoids were associated with 29 galling insect species represented in the following families: Torymidae (18.2\%), Eurytomidae (18.2\%), Eulophidae (18.2\%), Eupelmidae (9.1\%), Pteromalidae (9.1\%), family Braconidae (9.1\%), Platygastridae (9.1\%), and one unidentified (9.1\%). Most parasitoid species parasitized several gall species (Torymus sp.: 51.1\%, Eurytoma sp.: 49.7\%, Torymoides sp.: 46.9\%). Therefore, the effects of variation in plant defenses do not extend to the third trophic level, because a few species of parasitoids can determine the community structure and composition of galling insect species in tropical plants, and instead, top-down processes seem to be regulating trophic interactions of galling insect species in tropical gall communities.},

Both the shape of the pollination kernel and the spatial distribution of trees affect the distribution of pollen grains and the genotypes they harbour, but little is known about the relative contribution of each of these two factors. Using genetic markers we build a spatial network of pollination events between any two trees in a population of Prunus mahaleb, an insect-pollinated plant. Then, we apply tools from the science of complex networks to characterize the structure of such a mating network. Although the distribution of the number of pollen donors per tree is quite homogeneous, the identity of donors is distributed heterogeneously across the population. This results in a population structured in well-defined modules or compartments, formed by a group of mother trees and their shared pollen donors. Long-distance pollination events decrease the modular structure by favouring mating among all available mates. This increases gene flow across the entire population, reducing its genetic structure, and potentially decreasing the role of genetic drift.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims ‘Pollination syndromes’ are suites of phenotypic traits hypothesized to reflect convergent adaptations of flowers for pollination by specific types of animals. They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant–pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers.
Methods Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized.
Key Results Ordination of flowers in a multivariate ‘phenotype space’ defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space.
Conclusions The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes.},

Here, we assemble data on avian traits across a global sample of mutualistic plant–frugivore networks to critically assess how the functional roles of frugivores are associated with their intrinsic traits, as well as their evolutionary and functional distinctiveness. We find strong evidence for niche complementarity, with phenotypically and phylogenetically distinct birds interacting with more unique sets of plants. However, interaction strengths—the number of plant species dependent on a frugivore—were unrelated to evolutionary or functional distinctiveness, largely because distinct frugivores tend to be locally rare, and thus have fewer connections across the network. Instead, interaction strengths were better predicted by intrinsic traits, including body size, gape width and dietary specialization. Our analysis provides general support for the use of traits in quantifying species ecological functions, but also highlights the need to go beyond simple metrics of functional or phylogenetic diversity to consider the multiple pathways through which traits may determine ecological processes.},

Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance.

	abstract = {Summary
Uncovering the processes that shape the architecture of interaction networks is a major challenge in ecology. Studies have consistently revealed that more closely related taxa tend to show greater overlap in interaction partners, fuelling the idea that interactions are phylogenetically conserved [1–8]. However, local ecological processes such as exploitative or apparent competition (indirect interactions) might instead cause a decrease in overlap in interacting partners. Because of the taxonomic and geographic coarseness of existing studies [2–5, 7], the structuring effect of such processes has been overlooked. Here, we assess the relative importance of phylogeny and ecological processes in a local, highly resolved, four-level antagonistic network. Across all network levels we consistently find that phylogenetic relatedness among resource species is correlated with consumer overlap but that phylogenetic relatedness among consumer species is not or negatively correlated with resource overlap. This pervasive pattern indicates that the antagonistic network has been shaped by both phylogeny on resource range and by exploitative competition limiting resource overlap among closely related consumer species. Intriguingly, the strength of phylogenetic signal varies in a consistent way across the network levels. We discuss the generality of our findings and their implications in a changing world.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetically related species share a common evolutionary history and may therefore have similar traits. In terms of interaction networks, where traits are a major determinant, related species should therefore interact with other species which are also related. However, this prediction is challenged by current evidence that there is a weak, albeit significant, phylogenetic signal in species’ taxonomic niche, i.e., the identity of interacting species. We studied mutualistic and antagonistic plant–insect interaction networks in species-rich alpine meadows and show that there is instead a very strong phylogenetic signal in species’ functional niches—i.e., the mean functional traits of their interactors. This pattern emerges because related species tend to interact with species bearing certain traits that allow biotic interactions (pollination, herbivory) but not necessarily with species from all the same evolutionary lineages. Those traits define a set of potential interactors and show clear patterns of phylogenetic clustering on several portions of plants and insect phylogenies. Thus, this emerging pattern of low phylogenetic signal in taxonomic niches but high phylogenetic signal in functional niches may be driven by the interplay between functional trait convergence across plants’ and insects’ phylogenies and random sampling of the potential interactors.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plant–herbivore networks are highly specialized in their interactions, yet they are highly variable with regard to the relative importance of specific host species for herbivores. How host species traits determine specialization and species strength in this antagonistic network is still an unanswered question that we addressed in this study.
METHODS: We assessed plant cover and antiherbivore resistance traits to assess the extent to which they accounted for the variation in specialization and strength of interactions among species in a plant–herbivore network. We studied a tropical antagonistic network including a diverse herbivore–host plant assemblages in different habitat types and climatic seasons, including host plants with different life histories.
KEY RESULTS: Particular combinations of leaf toughness, trichome density, and phenolic compounds influenced herbivore specialization and host species strength, but with a significant spatiotemporal variation among plant life histories. Conversely, plant–herbivore network parameters were not influenced by plant cover.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of species-specific resistance traits of plants to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of plant–herbivore interaction networks. The novelty of our research lies in the use of a trait-based approach to understand the variation observed in diverse plant–herbivore networks.},

A plant might be less colonized and experience associational resistance when it grows near repellent neighbors. In contrast, it might be more colonized and experience associational susceptibility near attractive neighbors. To date, mechanisms that drive associational defense are not really understood. In order to gain insights into the occurrence of associational resistance versus associational susceptibility under field conditions, we conducted an experiment to determine the influence of neighboring plants on the colonization of a focal plant by aphids. The focal plant was always Brassica oleracea. The neighbors were B. oleracea (control), B. napus, B. nigra, or Solanum lycopersicum, which represent contrasting levels of physical and chemical defenses. The focal plant, B. oleracea, was more colonized by the specialist aphid Brevicoryne brassicae, and experienced associational susceptibility when it was surrounded by B. nigra or B. napus. In contrast, B.oleracea was less colonized by the generalist aphid Myzus persicae, and experienced associational resistance when it was surrounded by S.lycopersicum, B. nigra or B. napus. Neighboring plants had no significant impact on host plant choice by the generalist aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. In conclusion, attraction or repulsion of the specialist aphid B. brassicae and the generalist aphid M. persicae by B. nigra, B. napus, and S.lycopersicum resulted in associational susceptibility or associational resistance for B. oleracea.},

	abstract = {Food preferences and food availability are two major determinants of the diet of generalist herbivores and of their spatial distribution. How do these factors interact and eventually lead to diet differentiation in co-occurring herbivores? We quantified the diet of four grasshopper species co-occurring in subalpine grasslands using DNA barcoding of the plants contained in the faeces of individuals sampled in the field. The food preferences of each grasshopper species were assessed by a choice (cafeteria) experiment from among 24 plant species common in five grassland plots, in which the four grasshoppers were collected, while the habitat was described by the relative abundance of plant species in the grassland plots. Plant species were characterised by their leaf economics spectrum (LES), quantifying their nutrient vs. structural tissue content. The grasshoppers’ diet, described by the mean LES of the plants eaten, could be explained by their plant preferences but not by the available plants in their habitat. The diet differed significantly across four grasshopper species pairs out of six, which validates food preferences assessed in standardised conditions as indicators for diet partitioning in nature. In contrast, variation of the functional diversity (FD) for LES in the diet was mostly correlated to the FD of the available plants in the habitat, suggesting that diet mixing depends on the environment and is not an intrinsic property of the grasshopper species. This study sheds light on the mechanisms determining the feeding niche of herbivores, showing that food preferences influence niche position whereas habitat diversity affects niche breadth.},

We analyzed pollen deposition on stigmas of 57 flowering species to build a picture of plant–plant interactions via HPT in a biodiverse alpine meadow in southwest China. Plant species were categorized as pollen donors or recipients by their link numbers and link qualities. We identified 3609 heterospecific pollen grains, representing 410 links among 69 pollen species. Each plant species received on average 7.2 pollen species and donated its pollen to 5.5 species; only a few species donated or received large amounts of pollen or pollen from a large number of species. Compared to specialized plants, generalized plants tended to receive more heterospecific pollen but exported no more pollen to other species. Plant position in the network was related to both floral traits (stigma position) and pollinator generalization level. When different species share the same pollinator, bidirectional HPT may occur, but this was rarely observed in the species-rich community, indicating that interspecific pollen interference was largely unidirectional. Our study highlights the importance of understanding how sympatric flowering plants reduce deleterious effects of HPT, for example via stigma position. This study is the first to present a pollen transfer network for an entire community and to unravel its properties using directed network analysis.},

We address this knowledge gap by quantifying the within-season turnover of plant–pollinator interactions from weekly censuses across 3 years in a subalpine ecosystem. Week-to-week turnover of interactions (1) was high, (2) followed a consistent seasonal progression in all years of study and (3) was dominated by interaction rewiring (the reassembly of interactions among species). Simulation models revealed that species’ phenologies and relative abundances constrained both total interaction turnover and rewiring. Our findings reveal the diversity of species interactions that may be missed when the temporal dynamics of networks are ignored.},

How closely related invasive species are to species in the native recipient community may drive patterns of herbivore and pathogen damage and therefore, may be important in understanding the success of some invasions. We compared herbivore and pathogen damage across a group of invasive species occurring in natural environments on the east coast of Australia. We examined whether the level of damage experienced by the invasive species was associated with the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between these plants and the native plants within the region. We found that phylogenetic distance to the nearest native relative was a good predictor of herbivore and pathogen damage on the invasive plants, explaining nearly 37 \% of the variance in leaf damage. Total leaf damage and the variety of damage types declined with increasing phylogenetic distance to the nearest native relative. In addition, as the phylogenetic distance to the nearest native relative increased, invasive species were colonized by fewer functional guilds and the herbivore assemblage was increasingly dominated by generalist species. These results suggest that invasive species that are only distantly related to those in the native invaded community may be released from specialist natural enemies. Our results indicate that the phylogenetic relatedness of invasive plants to species in native communities is a significant predictor of the rate of colonization by the herbivore and pathogen community, and thus a useful tool to assess invasion potential.},

To estimate the sign of the effects (positive, neutral or negative), the relation between conspecific and heterospecific pollen deposited on stigmas was analysed with GLMMs. Network analyses showed that communities were characterised by the presence of pollen hub-donors and receptors. We inferred that facilitative and neutral pollinator-mediated interactions among plants prevailed over competition. Thus, the benefits from pollinator sharing seem to outweigh the costs (i.e. heterospecific deposition and conspecific pollen loss). The largest proportion of facilitated species was found at the highest elevation community, suggesting that under unfavourable conditions for the pollination service and at lower plant densities facilitation can be more common.},

We use the Global Pest and Disease Database, an internal database maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service – Plant Protection and Quarantine Division (USDA APHIS-PPQ), to evaluate the strength of the phylogenetic signal in host range for nine major groups of plant pests and pathogens. Eight of nine groups showed significant phylogenetic signal in host range. Additionally, pests and pathogens with more known hosts attacked a phylogenetically broader range of hosts. This suggests that easily obtained data – the number of known hosts and the phylogenetic distance between known hosts and other species of interest – can be used to predict which plant species are likely to be susceptible to a particular pest. This can facilitate rapid assessment of risk from novel pests and pathogens when empirical host range data are not yet available and guide efficient collection of empirical data for risk evaluation.},

We also evaluated the role of species body size, local abundance, regional frequency and phylogeny as determinants of network topology. 3. We found both food webs to be compartmented, with interaction range boundaries imposed by host phylogeny. Species degree within compartments was mostly related to their regional frequency and local abundance. Only one compartment showed an internal nested structure in the distribution of interactions between species, but species position within this compartment was unrelated to species size or abundance. 4. These results suggest that compartmentalization may be more common than previously considered, and that network structure is a result of multiple, hierarchical, non-exclusive processes.},

	abstract = {Various definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystem-specific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.},

	abstract = {Because it is so difficult to monitor and manage every aspect of biodiversity, several shortcuts have been proposed whereby we monitor and/or protect single species. The indicator species concept is problematic because there is no consensus on what the indicator is supposed to indicate and because it is difficult to know which is the best indicator species even when we agree on what it should indicate. The umbrella species (a species that needs such large tracts of habitat that saving it will automatically save many other species) seems like a better approach, although often whether many other species will really fall under the umbrella is a matter of faith rather than research. Intensive management of an indicator or an umbrella species (for example, by transplant or supplemental feeding) is a contradiction in terms because the rest of the community to be indicated or protected does not receive such treatment. A flagship species, normally a charismatic large vertebrate, is one that can be used to anchor a conservation campaign because it arouses public interest and sympathy, but a flagship need not be a good indicator or umbrella. And conservation of flagship species is often very expensive. Further, management regimes of two flagship species can conflict. Ecosystem management, often on a landscape scale, is a proposed solution to problems of single-species management. Keep the ecosystem healthy, according to this view, and component species will all thrive. However, conservationists have concerns about ecosystem management. First, it is variously defined, and many definitions emphasize the commodities ecosystems provide for humans rather than how humans can protect ecosystems. Second, the term ‘ecosystem health’ is ill-defined and associated with an outmoded, superorganismic view of the ecosystem. Third, ecosystem management seems focused on processes and so would appear to permit losses of species so long as they did not greatly affect processes like nutrient-cycling. Fourth, ecosystem management is often implemented by adaptive management. This may make it difficult to study the underlying mechanisms driving an ecosystem and to know when an entirely new management approach is needed. Thus, some conservationists see ecosystem management as a Trojan horse that would allow continued environmental destruction in the name of modern resource management. The recognition that some ecosystems have keystone species whose activities govern the well-being of many other species suggests an approach that may unite the best features of single-species and ecosystem management. If we can identify keystone species and the mechanisms that cause them to have such wide-ranging impacts, we would almost certainly derive information on the functioning of the entire ecosystem that would be useful in its management. Some keystone species themselves may be appropriate targets for management, but, even when they are not, our understanding of the ecosystem will be greatly increased. Keystone species may not be a panacea, however. We do not yet know how many ecosystems have keystone species, and the experiments that lead to their identification are often very difficult.},

Here, we use an 8-y, continuous record of fruit fall from a 1.44-ha mature forest stand to identify potential KPRs in a lowland western Amazonian rain forest. KPRs were identified based on four criteria: temporal non-redundancy; year-to-year reliability; abundance of reproductive-size individuals and inferred fruit crop size; and the variety of vertebrate consumers utilizing their fruit. Overall, seven species were considered excellent KPRs: two of these belong to the genus Ficus, confirming that this taxon is a KPR as previously suggested. Celtis iguanaea (Cannabaceae) – a canopy liana – has also been previously classified as a KPR; in addition, Pseudomalmea diclina (Annonaceae), Cissus ulmifolia (Vitaceae), Allophylus glabratus (Sapindaceae) and Trichilia elegans (Meliaceae) are newly identified KPRs. Our results confirm that a very small fraction ({\textless}5\%) of the plant community consistently provides fruit for a broad set of consumers during the period of resource scarcity, which has significant implications for the conservation and management of Amazonian forests.},

	abstract = {One of the major questions in ecology is, what controls the structure of communities? We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long—term (1962—1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food—web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system. We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown—of—thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (°20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The intermediate disturbance “hypothesis” does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow—water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after major disturbance). Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization. We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying “keystone” species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.},

Black-tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus occur from Canada to Mexico in grasslands of the western Great Plains of North America. Black-tailed prairie dogs alter vegetation and dig extensive burrow systems that alter grassland habitats for plants and other animal species. These alterations of habitat justify the descriptor “ecological engineer,” and the resulting changes in species composition have earned them status as a keystone species. We examined the impact of black-tailed prairie dogs on small mammal assemblages by trapping at on- and off-colony locations at eight study areas across the species' geographic range. We posed 2 nested hypotheses: 1) prairie dogs function as a keystone species for other rodent species; and 2) the keystone role varies spatially. Assuming that it does, we asked what are the sources of the variation? Black-tailed prairie dogs consistently functioned as a keystone species in that there were strong statistically significant differences in community composition on versus off prairie dog colonies across the species range in prairie grassland. Small mammal species composition varied along both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, and species richness varied from 4 to 11. Assemblages closer together were more similar; such correlations approximately doubled when including only on- or off-colony grids. Black-tailed prairie dogs had a significant effect on associated rodent assemblages that varied regionally, dependent upon the composition of the local rodent species pool. Over the range of the black-tailed prairie dog, on-colony rodent richness and evenness were less variable, and species composition was more consistent than off-colony assemblages.},

	abstract = {Foraging success of predators profoundly depends on reliable and detectable cues indicating the presence of their often inconspicuous prey. Carnivorous insects rely on chemical cues to optimize foraging efficiency. Hyperparasitoids that lay their eggs in the larvae or pupae of parasitic wasps may find their parasitoid hosts developing in different herbivores. They can use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to locate parasitized caterpillars. Because different herbivore species induce different HIPV emission from plants, hyperparasitoids may have to deal with large variation in volatile information that indicates host presence. In this study, we used an ecogenomics approach to first address whether parasitized caterpillars of two herbivore species (Pieris rapae and P. brassicae) induce similar transcriptional and metabolomic responses in wild Brassica oleracea plants and, second, whether hyperparasitoids Lysibia nana are able to discriminate between these induced plant responses to locate their parasitoid host in different herbivores under both laboratory and field conditions. Our study revealed that both herbivore identity and parasitism affect plant transcriptional and metabolic responses to herbivory. We also found that hyperparasitoids are able to respond to HIPVs released by wild B. oleracea under both laboratory and field conditions. In addition, we observed stronger attraction of hyperparasitoids to HIPVs when plants were infested with parasitized caterpillars. However, hyperparasitoids were equally attracted to plants infested by either herbivore species. Our results indicate that parasitism plays a major role in HIPV-mediated plant-hyperparasitoid interactions. Furthermore, these findings also indicate that plant trait-mediated indirect interaction networks play important roles in community-wide species interactions.},

Despite being critically important for improving conservation practice, there have been few systematic analyses of the popular use of conservation terminology. This paper draws from science communication studies and metaphor analysis, to examine how keystone, flagship and umbrella species concepts are used and represented in non-academic contexts. 557 news articles containing these terms were systematically analyzed. Mammals featured in 60\% of articles on keystones, 55\% on flagships and 63\% on umbrella species. Number of articles explaining the terms keystone (35\%) and flagship (31\%) was low, and keystones were the most misrepresented term. Keystones were metaphorically linked with balance, flagships with representation and umbrella species with protection. These metaphors influenced public interpretation of scientific terminology, oriented actions towards select species, and led to a valuation of such actions. Together, the findings highlight three important aspects of popular use of conservation terminology: (1) communication is largely biased towards mammals, (2) everyday language plays a vital role in the interpretation of concepts, and (3) metaphors influence peoples’ actions and understanding. Conservation biologists need to engage with issues of language if public conservation literacy is to be improved. Further evaluations of concepts with high public and policy relevance, systematic identification of communication shortfalls, and linguistic assessments prior to promoting new terms are potential ways of achieving this.},

Two concepts relating to the influence of individual species on the biocenoses in which they occur are reviewed. The first, the general functional importance of a species, is denned as the sum, over all species, of the changes (sign ignored) in productivity which would occur on removal of the particular species from the biocenosis. General functional importance is calculated as:

where Pj is the productivity of the jth species before (t= 0) and after (t= 1) removal of the particular (ith) species being evaluated. Though Ii values cannot be determined empirically, this concept raises provocative questions for theoretical biocenology. The second concept reviewed is that of the keystone species. Never having been precisely or operationally defined,‘keystone’ has come to mean little more than ‘important for something.’ Moreover, there is no empirical or theoretical foundation for the idea that there exists in any biocenosis a natural dichotomy corresponding to the verbal one of keystone and non-keystone species. Some investigators have implied that such a dichotomy is suggested by the frequency distributions of experimentally determined values of interaction strength. The patterns they refer to are, however, artifacts resulting from small sample sizes and the plotting of frequency distributions on arithmetic rather than logarithmic scales. As a casual metaphor ‘keystone species’ was appealing and harmless; but the pretence that it is a well-defined concept or phenomenon has had a stultifying effect on ecological thought and argument.},

	abstract = {Mistletoes are a diverse group of parasitic plants with a worldwide distribution. The hemiparasitic growth form is critical to understanding their biology, buffering variation in resource availability that constrains the distribution and growth of most plants. This is manifested in many aspects of mistletoe life history, including extended phenologies, abundant and high-quality fruits and nectar, and few chemical or structural defenses. Most mistletoe species rely on animals for both pollination and fruit dispersal, and this leads to a broad range of mistletoe-animal interactions. In this review, I summarize research on mistletoe biology and synthesize results from studies of mistletoe-animal interactions. I consolidate records of mistletoe-vertebrate interactions, incorporating species from 97 vertebrate families recorded as consuming mistletoe and from 50 using mistletoe as nesting sites. There is widespread support for regarding mistletoe as a keystone resource, and all quantitative data are consistent with mistletoe functioning as a determinant of alpha diversity. Manipulative experiments are highlighted as a key priority, and six explicit predictions are provided to guide future experimental research. The facts which kept me longest scientifically orthodox are those of adaptation—the pollen-masses in Asclepias—the misseltoe, with its pollen carried by insects and seed by Birds—the woodpecker, with its feet and tail, beak and tongue, to climb the tree and secure insects. To talk of climate or Lamarckian habit producing such adaptation to other organic beings is futile. This difficulty, I believe I have surmounted. From a letter to Asa Gray by Charles Darwin, 1857.},

However, because these mussels are a foundational species, they provide three-dimensional habitat for over 300 associated species inhabiting the mussel beds; thus, removing sea stars significantly increases community-wide diversity. In any case, most ecologists cite Paine (1966) to support a statement that predators increase diversity by interfering with competition. Although detractors remained skeptical of top-down effects and keystone concepts, the paradigm that predation increases diversity spread.

	abstract = {Keystone plants that produce seasonally critical trophic resources comprise one of the main classes of keystone species, yet no studies have attempted to examine the ecological attributes that might help us recognize them and evaluate their importance in species-rich plant assemblages. In this paper the concept of keystone plant resources is reviewed using potential candidates proposed in the literature for neotropical forest sites. A poorly known example of a potential keystone resource-the gums produced by mature pods of two emergent tree species (Parkia nitida and P. pendula, Leguminosae: Mimosoideae)-is described for primates and other arboreal vertebrates in Amazonian forests. In particular, the fruiting phenology, tree density, patterns of vertebrate consumption, and nutritional quality of Parkia gums in Amazonian terra firme forests are considered. Putative neotropical keystone resources are then divided into four intersecting ecological attributes defining their community-wide importance to vertebrate frugivores: (1) temporal redundancy, (2) degree of consumer specificity, (3) reliability, and (4) abundance. From a vertebrate perspective, keystone plants are here defined as those producing reliable, low-redundancy resources that are consumed by a large proportion of the bird and mammal assemblage with which they coexist. Plant populations proposed to date as keystone species range widely across two of these four variables, which may disqualify most putative taxa (including Parkia spp.) from a more formal definition of keystone resources. Other importance attributes, the context-dependent role, the taxonomic refinement, and removal effects of the keystone plant resource concept as applied to tropical forests are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract: It has been suggested that the keystone-species concept should be dropped from ecology and conservation, primarily because the concept is poorly defined. This prompted Power et al. (1996) to refine the definition: keystone species have large effects on community structure or ecosystem function (i.e., high overall importance), and this effect should be large relative to abundance (i.e., high community importance). Using prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) as an example, I review operational and conceptual difficulties encountered in applying this definition. As applied to prairie dogs, the implicit assumption that overall importance is a linear function of abundance is invalid. In addition, community importance is sensitive to abundance levels, the definition of community, and sampling scale. These problems arise largely from the equation for community importance, as used in conjunction with removal experiments at single abundance levels. I suggest that we shift from the current emphasis on the dualism between keystone and nonkeystone species and instead examine how overall and community importance vary (1) with abundance, (2) across spatial and temporal scales, and (3) under diverse ecological conditions. In addition, I propose that a third criterion be incorporated into the definition: keystone species perform roles not performed by other species or processes. Examination of how these factors vary among populations of keystone species should help identify the factors contributing to, or limiting, keystone-level functions, thereby increasing the usefulness of the keystone-species concept in ecology and conservation. Although the quantitative framework of Power et al. falls short of being fully operational, my conceptual guidelines may improve the usefulness of the keystone-species concept. Careful attention to the factors that limit keystone function will help avoid misplaced emphasis on keystone species at the expense of other species.},

	abstract = {Many herbivorous insects feed on plant tissues as larvae but use other resources as adults. Adult nectar feeding is an important component of the diet of many adult herbivores, but few studies have compared adult and larval feeding for broad groups of insects. We compiled a data set of larval host use and adult nectar sources for 995 butterfly and moth species (Lepidoptera) in central Europe. Using a phylogenetic generalized least squares approach, we found that those Lepidoptera that fed on a wide range of plant species as larvae were also nectar feeding on a wide range of plant species as adults. Lepidoptera that lack functional mouthparts as adults used more plant species as larval hosts, on average, than did Lepidoptera with adult mouthparts. We found that 54\% of Lepidoptera include their larval host as a nectar source. By creating null models that described the similarity between larval and adult nectar sources, we furthermore showed that Lepidoptera nectar feed on their larval host more than would be expected if they fed at random on available nectar sources. Despite nutritional differences between plant tissue and nectar, we show that there are similarities between adult and larval feeding in Lepidoptera. This suggests that either behavioral or digestive constraints are retained throughout the life cycle of holometabolous herbivores, which affects host breadth and identity.},

	abstract = {Resource exploitation and competition were measured for 13 herbivorous stem—boring insects inhabiting a climax prairie in Illinois. Nine species overlapped {\textgreater} 70\% in their exploitation of plant species, stem sizes, and locations within stems, but competition was detected between only two species. In this case the competition resulted from aggression rather than exploitation for limited resources, and exclusion may be delayed or prevented by specific behaviors or refuges. To quantify how closely the guild members were packed upon the available resources, probabilities of coccurrences between species were calculated using resource abundances, population sizes, and overlaps in resource exploitation. The species packing averaged over the entire guild was 30\%, but some species had several potential competitors and probabilities of cooccurrences were {\textgreater} 60\%. This species structure offers the conditions for diffuse competition, but competition seldom occurred because stems could support several individuals and resources were generally nonlimiting. Although the potential for competition is high and species probably compete occasionally, the high resource overlap and species richness that competition has not been a major organizing force within this guild. When factors known to influence competition are considered, it seems possible that competition has been too infrequent, mild, or nondirectional to cause strong selection for competitive avoidance or displacement. This guild demonstrates that overlap values may not equal competition coefficients and that high overlap may exist because competition is rare. This guild is probably not unique in lacking competitive organization; herbivorous insects may be among the least likely groups to exhibit the patterns predicted by competition theory.},

The value of the system lies in the accuracy of host affiliations. A total of 138 species and subspecies of plants were sampled, representing approximately 87\% of the Leguminosae in Hungary. Only 51 legume species (37.0\%) harboured bruchids (12 Bruchus spp. and 15 Bruchidius spp). Bruchids occurred in 38.3\% of the host plant samples. Thirty-seven plant species congeneric with bruchid host species were unoccupied by bruchids. The degree of host specificity ranged from monophagy (at least ecological monophagy) to oligophagy. On the basis of presence/absence data we tested the null hypothesis assuming that plant taxa and seed consuming bruchid species form congruent phyletic relations at the species level. We argue that the case for coevolution between the beetles and their hosts is weak. A comparison of the available taxonomic relationships (and presumed phylogenies) best fits a case of sequential evolution, with stronger phylogenetic conservatism in Bruchus species than in Bruchidius species. Bruchid and host plant taxa showed rough congruence only at the tribe level. We suggest that host shifts are best explained by the changes in the bruchids’ chemosensory system that determines the females’ host selection behaviour.},

The egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) responded to synomones emitted by leguminous plants induced by feeding and oviposition activity of the bug Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). This was shown by laboratory bioassays using a Y-tube olfactometer. Broad bean leaves (Vicia faba L.) damaged by feeding activity of N. viridula and on which host egg mass had been laid produced synomones that attracted T. basalis. By contrast, undamaged leaves or feeding-damaged leaves without eggs did not attract wasp females. French bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) also emitted attractive synomones when they were damaged by host feeding and carrying egg masses. Thus, release of feeding- and oviposition-induced synomones does not seem to be plant-specific. Synomone production was shown to be a systemically induced plant physiological response to feeding damage and oviposition. Also, parts of the plant that were left undamaged and did not carry host eggs emitted attractive synomones when other parts of the plant were damaged by feeding and carrying eggs. Furthermore, wasps were not attracted by N. viridula egg masses offered alone or combined with damaged broad bean leaves. Thus, the attractiveness of feeding-damaged leaves carrying eggs is due to induction by feeding and oviposition rather than due to a combined effect of attractive volatiles released from eggs and damaged leaves. The production of synomones was influenced by the age of the host egg mass, because feeding-damaged leaves bearing egg masses attracted the parasitoid until the eggs were ∼72-96 h old but not once the larvae had hatched from the eggs (∼120 h old). These results show that annual plants are able to produce synomones as a consequence of feeding and egg mass oviposition by a sucking insect.},

Generalizing from our investigations involving Cotesia congregata (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), we suggest that under some conditions, populations of insect parasitoids may adapt to specific plants or to the allelochemicals produced by these plants. Adaptations to plants in insect parasitoids can include increased survivorship and fixation of some components of foraging behavior and may be facilitated by postemergence learning. Variation in the ability to tolerate plant allelochemicals among parasitoid populations may be exploited to enhance biological control efforts.},

We investigated the behavioural responses of the parasitoid Cotesia vestalis to VOCs from a plant–herbivore complex consisting of cabbage plants (Brassica oleracea) and the parasitoids host caterpillar, Plutella xylostella. A Y-tube olfactometer was used to compare the parasitoids' responses to VOCs produced as a result of different levels of attack by the caterpillar and equivalent levels of mechanical damage. Headspace VOC production by these plant treatments was examined using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Cotesia vestalis were able to exploit quantitative and qualitative differences in volatile emissions, from the plant–herbivore complex, produced as a result of different numbers of herbivores feeding. Cotesia vestalis showed a preference for plants with more herbivores and herbivore damage, but did not distinguish between different levels of mechanical damage. Volatile profiles of plants with different levels of herbivores/herbivore damage could also be separated by canonical discriminant analyses. Analyses revealed a number of compounds whose emission increased significantly with herbivore load, and these VOCs may be particularly good indicators of herbivore number, as the parasitoid processes cues from its external environment.},

Tobacco, cotton and maize plants each produce distinct volatile blends in response to damage by two closely related herbivore species, Heliothis virescens and Helicoverpa zea. The specialist parasitic wasp Cardiochiles nigriceps exploits these differences to distinguish infestation by its host, H. virescens, from that by H.zea. The production by phylogenetically diverse plant species and the exploitation by parasitoids of highly specific chemical signals, keyed to individual herbivore species, indicates that the interaction between plants and the natural enemies of the herbivores that attack them is more sophisticated than previously realized.},

Using the plant DNA barcode markers rbcL and matK, we have assembled 97.7\% coverage for rbcL, 90.2\% for matK, and a dual-locus barcode for 89.7\% of the native Welsh flora. We have sampled multiple individuals for each species, resulting in 3304 rbcL and 2419 matK sequences. The majority of our samples (85\%) are from DNA extracted from herbarium specimens. Recoverability of DNA barcodes is lower using herbarium specimens, compared to freshly collected material, mostly due to lower amplification success, but this is balanced by the increased efficiency of sampling species that have already been collected, identified, and verified by taxonomic experts. The effectiveness of the DNA barcodes for identification (level of discrimination) is assessed using four approaches: the presence of a barcode gap (using pairwise and multiple alignments), formation of monophyletic groups using Neighbour-Joining trees, and sequence similarity in BLASTn searches. These approaches yield similar results, providing relative discrimination levels of 69.4 to 74.9\% of all species and 98.6 to 99.8\% of genera using both markers. Species discrimination can be further improved using spatially explicit sampling. Mean species discrimination using barcode gap analysis (with a multiple alignment) is 81.6\% within 10×10 km squares and 93.3\% for 2×2 km squares. Our database of DNA barcodes for Welsh native flowering plants and conifers represents the most complete coverage of any national flora, and offers a valuable platform for a wide range of applications that require accurate species identification.},

Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using {\textgreater}1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a “DNA barcoding gap” is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing {\textgreater}1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes.},

	abstract = {The last decades have seen an upsurge in ecological studies incorporating phylogenetic information with increasing species samples, motivated by the common conjecture that species with common ancestors should share some ecological characteristics due to niche conservatism. This has been carried out using various methods of increasing complexity and reliability: using only taxonomical classification; constructing supertrees that incorporate only topological information from previously published phylogenies; or building supermatrices of molecular data that are used to estimate phylogenies with evolutionary meaningful branch lengths. Although the latter option is more informative than the others, it remains under-used in ecology because ecologists are generally unaware of or unfamiliar with modern molecular phylogenetic methods. However, a solid phylogenetic hypothesis is necessary to conduct reliable ecological analysis integrating evolutive aspects. Our aim here is to clarify the concepts and methodological issues associated with the reconstruction of dated megaphylogenies, and to show that it is nowadays possible to obtain accurate and well sampled megaphylogenies with informative branch-lengths on large species samples. This is possible thanks to improved phylogenetic methods, vast amounts of molecular data available from databases such as Genbank, and consensus knowledge on deep phylogenetic relationships for an increasing number of groups of organisms. Finally, we include a detailed step-by-step workflow pipeline (Supplementary material), from data acquisition to phylogenetic inference, mainly based on the R environment (widely used by ecologists) and the use of free web-servers, that has been applied to the reconstruction of a species-level phylogeny of all breeding birds of Europe.},

Although the need for a multifaceted view of diversity based on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions is now commonly recognized, there are no complete risk assessments concerning their expected changes. In this paper, we used a range of species distribution models in an ensemble-forecasting framework together with regional climate and land cover projections by 2080 to analyze the potential threat for more than 2500 plant species at high resolution (2.5 × 2.5 km) in the French Alps. We also decomposed taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity facets into α and β components and analyzed their expected changes by 2080. Overall, plant species threats from climate and land cover changes in the French Alps were expected to vary depending on the species' preferred altitudinal vegetation zone, rarity, and conservation status. Indeed, rare species and species of conservation concern were the ones projected to experience less severe change, and also the ones being the most efficiently preserved by the current network of protected areas. Conversely, the three facets of plant diversity were also projected to experience drastic spatial re-shuffling by 2080. In general, the mean α-diversity of the three facets was projected to increase to the detriment of regional β-diversity, although the latter was projected to remain high at the montane-alpine transition zones. Our results show that, due to a high-altitude distribution, the current protection network is efficient for rare species, and species predicted to migrate upward. Although our modeling framework may not capture all possible mechanisms of species range shifts, our work illustrates that a comprehensive risk assessment on an entire floristic region combined with functional and phylogenetic information can help delimitate future scenarios of biodiversity and better design its protection.},

Functional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity that is increasingly being measured to quantify its changes following disturbance and to understand its effects on ecosystem functioning. Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed. However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces.


Innovation

Here we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a functional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assemblages, using simulated datasets and a real study case.


Main conclusions

The quality of functional space strongly varied between situations. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while functional dendrograms and two-dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor-quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore, we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.},

Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive.

As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees (≥10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co‐occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.},

Important topological properties of networks such as nestedness and modularity are thought to be affected by coevolution. However, there has been no test whether coevolution does, in fact, lead to predictable network structure. Here, we investigate the structure of simulated bipartite networks generated under different modes of coevolution. We ask whether evolutionary processes influence network structure and, furthermore, whether any emergent trends are influenced by the strength or “intimacy” of the species interactions. We find that coevolution leaves a weak and variable signal on network topology, particularly nestedness and modularity, which was not strongly affected by the intimacy of interactions. Our findings indicate that network metrics, on their own, should not be used to make inferences about processes underlying the evolutionary history of communities. Instead, a more holistic approach that combines network approaches with traditional phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions is needed.},

Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

However, if a locally rare species is very attractive in terms of the rewards it offers pollinators, it may be preferentially visited. Spiranthes romanzoffiana is a nectar rewarding, geographically rare, endangered orchid species which forms small populations in Ireland, co-flowering with more common, florally rewarding species. We examined visitation rates to S. romanzoffiana and two nectar rewarding co-flowering species (Mentha aquatica and Prunella vulgaris) in the west of Ireland. These three plant species were visited by three bee species (Bombus pascuorum, B. hortorum and Apis mellifera). B. pascuorum was the most common visitor, while A. mellifera was least common. Our results suggest that individual S. romanzoffiana inflorescences compete intraspecifically for visitation from pollinators at high densities. The relationship between visitation to S. romanzoffiana and total floral density appeared to be positive, suggesting interspecific facilitation of pollinator visitation at high densities. Nectar standing crop varied through the season, among species and between open and bagged flowers. Nectar standing crop was not correlated with visitation in S. romanzoffiana. Despite relatively high visitation, S. romanzoffiana produced no mature fruit during this flowering season. The lack of fruit maturation in this species may be a major factor causing its rarity in Europe.},

Nectar robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of a flower to ‘steal’ nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing holes that others have made (secondary robbing). We found that experience of foraging from robbed flowers significantly promoted the development of primary robbing in previously legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its adoption in others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically important role in the relationship between plants and pollinators.},

	abstract = {Pollinator-mediated interactions between plants can play an important role for the dynamics of plant communities. Pollination services depend on the abundance and the foraging behaviour of pollinators, which in turn respond to the availability and distribution of floral resources (notably nectar sugar). However, it is still insufficiently understood how the ‘sugar landscapes’ provided by flowering plant communities shape pollinator-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and across different spatial scales. A better understanding of pollinator-mediated interactions requires an integrative approach that quantifies different aspects of sugar landscapes and investigates their relative importance for pollinator behaviour and plant reproductive success. In this study, we quantified such sugar landscapes from individual-based maps of Protea shrub communities in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. The 27 study sites of 4 ha each jointly comprise 127 993 individuals of 19 species. We analysed how rates of visitation by key bird pollinators and the seed set of plants respond to different aspects of sugar landscapes: the distribution of nectar sugar amounts, as well as their quality, taxonomic purity and phenology. We found that pollinator visitation rates strongly depended on phenological variation of site-scale sugar amounts. The seed set of focal plants increased with nectar sugar amounts of conspecific neighbours and with site-scale sugar amounts. Seed set increased particularly strongly if site-scale sugar amounts were provided by plants that offer less sugar per inflorescence. These combined effects of the amount, quality, purity and phenological variation of nectar sugar show that nectar sugar is a common interaction currency that determines how multiple plant species interact via shared pollinators. The responses of pollinator-mediated interactions to different aspects of this interaction currency alter conditions for species coexistence in Protea communities and may cause community-level Allee effects that promote extinction cascades.},

Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930–1969 to 1987–1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978–1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species. We consider how our findings relate to other recorded changes in the British flora, how they may help to explain declines in bumblebees and how they could contribute to a conservation strategy.},

Three treatments of lavender patches were set out: bumble bees excluded, honey bees excluded, control. Bumble bees are known to handle lavender flowers more rapidly than honey bees, partly due to their longer tongues. As predicted, excluding these superior competitors consistently (n = 4 trials) and greatly increased honey bee numbers per patch (14-fold increase; P {\textless} 0.001). The exclusion of bumble bee also caused multiple changes to honey bee foraging behaviour: time spent on a patch (+857 \%; P {\textless} 0.001), flower handling time (+16 \%, P = 0.040), interval between probed flowers (−27 \%, P = 0.012), proportion of interflower flights (−26 \%, P {\textless} 0.001) and flowers rejected (−12 \%, P {\textless} 0.001). Conversely, and also as predicted, excluding honey bees had no effect on bumble bee numbers or foraging behaviour. A key consequence of bumble bee exclusion was to increase the mean flower nectar content from 0.007 to 0.019 μl (+171 \%). By constructing an energy budget, we find that this leads to honey bees making a substantial, rather than a marginal, energetic profit per flower visited. Our results show the foraging behaviour of individual bees is extremely flexible and greatly influenced by the effects of interspecific competition on nectar rewards. Collectively, these individual decisions can have rapid and important consequences at the community level, including competitive exclusion.},

	abstract = {Pollinators, such as bees, often develop multi-location routes (traplines) to exploit subsets of flower patches within larger plant populations. How individuals establish such foraging areas in the presence of other foragers is poorly explored. Here we investigated the foraging patterns of pairs of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) released sequentially into an 880m2 outdoor flight cage containing 10 feeding stations (artificial flowers). Using motion-sensitive video cameras mounted on flowers, we mapped the flower visitation networks of both foragers, quantified their interactions and compared their foraging success over an entire day. Overall, bees that were released first (residents) travelled 37\% faster and collected 77\% more nectar, thereby reaching a net energy intake rate 64\% higher than bees released second (newcomers). However, this prior-experience advantage decreased as newcomers became familiar with the spatial configuration of the flower array. When both bees visited the same flower simultaneously, the most frequent outcome was for the resident to evict the newcomer. On the rare occasions when newcomers evicted residents, the two bees increased their frequency of return visits to that flower. These competitive interactions led to a significant (if only partial) spatial overlap between the foraging patterns of pairs of bees. While newcomers may initially use social cues (such as olfactory footprints) to exploit flowers used by residents, either because such cues indicate higher rewards and/or safety from predation, residents may attempt to preserve their monopoly over familiar resources through exploitation and interference. We discuss how these interactions may favour spatial partitioning, thereby maximising the foraging efficiency of individuals and colonies.},

	abstract = {. Many bumblebee species are declining at a rapid rate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. This is commonly attributed to the decline in floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming practices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources. Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban areas compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in suburban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggesting that this moth is more abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results demonstrate that gardens provide a greater density and diversity of floral resources than farmland, and probably support larger populations of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance farmland biodiversity appear to have little measurable impact on nest growth of this bumblebee species. We argue that B. terrestris probably forage over a larger scale than that on which farms are managed, so that nest growth is determined by the management of a large number of neighbouring farms, not just that in which the nest is located.},

	abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species’ abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

	abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic information is increasingly being used to understand the assembly of biological communities and ecological processes. However, commonly used metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD) do not incorporate information on the relative abundances of individuals within a community. In this study, we develop three indices of PD that explicitly consider species abundances. First, we present a metric of phylogenetic-abundance evenness that evaluates the relationship between the abundance and the distribution of terminal branch lengths. Second, we calculate an index of hierarchical imbalance of abundances at the clade level encapsulating the distribution of individuals across the nodes in the phylogeny. Third, we develop an index of abundance-weighted evolutionary distinctiveness and generate an entropic index of phylogenetic diversity that captures both information on evolutionary distances and phylogenetic tree topology, and also serves as a basis to evaluate species conservation value. These metrics offer measures of phylogenetic diversity incorporating different community attributes. We compare these new metrics to existing ones, and use them to explore diversity patterns in a typical California annual grassland plant community at the Jasper Ridge biological preserve.

	abstract = {Seed dispersal networks are often organized in nested structures in a way that a few core species can disproportionally affect the remaining species in a network, in both the ecological and evolutionary sense. Yet, the relative importance of core and peripheral species has not been properly tested in seed dispersal network studies. We determined core species from 10 local seed dispersal networks composed by fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds. Each of those local quantitative networks was characterized with a core quality value, a core score for each species and a threshold value between core and peripheral species. From a total of 52 bird and 69 plant species that interacted in the study area, only 8 and 15, respectively, were identified as core. Each local network had a core that comprised a small number of birds and plants, always lower than 30\% of the interacting species. There was no difference in the quantitative component of seed dispersal effectiveness (QC) provided by the frugivorous bird assemblage to plant functional groups clustered according to their growth form and fruit characteristics. Core birds dispersed seeds from each of these plant functional groups with a higher QC than peripheral species. Thus, we empirically demonstrate for the first time that seed dispersal networks at a regional scale have a small core set of fruit-eating birds, upon which heavily rely most fleshy-fruited plants for their seed removal. Hence, the activity of just a few core frugivores could deeply impact the demography of an entire assemblage of fleshy-fruited plants.},

Hence, we urgently need to examine the implications of biodiversity loss not only in terms of species conservation but also in terms of sustainability of ecosystem services. The ability of protected areas to maintain local species richness has been clearly demonstrated. However, preserving goods and services provided by ecosystems requires not only the conservation of species richness but also the conservation of the most ‘original’ species, i.e. the ones with the highest average rarity of their attributes which are likely to perform some unique functions in ecosystems. We proposed a new conservation of biological originality (CBO) index as well as associated randomization tests to quantify the ability of protected areas to maintain viable populations for the most original species. As an application, we used long-term fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR) to determine the species which benefited from the protection reinforcement in 1999. We also estimated a set of 14 ecomorphological functional traits on the 37 fish species caught in the BSNR and we obtained a functional originality value for each species. As a result, we found that functional originality was significantly protected in the fish assemblage of the BSNR: species with the most original functional trait combinations became more abundant after 1999. Our finding suggests that protecting most original species is an insurance against functional diversity erosion in the BSNR. More generally, our new index can be used to test whether protected areas may protect preferentially the most original species and whether restorative management promotes the reestablishment of the most original species with particular habitat requirements.},

Even though plant reproduction depends largely on seed dispersal, evolutionary ecologists have been unable to link co-occurring traits in fruits with differences in behavior, physiology, and morphology of fruit-eating vertebrates. Hence, the origin and maintenance of fruit diversity remains largely unexplained. Using a multivariate phylogenetic comparative test with unbiased estimates of odor and color in figs, we demonstrate that fruit traits evolve in concert and as predicted by differences in the behavior, physiology (perceptive ability) and morphology of their frugivorous seed dispersers. The correlated evolution of traits results in the convergence of general appearance of fruits in species that share disperser types. Observations at fruiting trees independently confirmed that differences in fig traits predict differences in dispersers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that differences among frugivores have shaped the evolution of fruit traits. More broadly, our results underscore the importance of mutualisms in both generating and maintaining biodiversity.},

We tested this hypothesis using a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we established bacterial species pools with different levels of phylogenetic relatedness and manipulated the immigration history of species from each pool into microcosms. Our results showed that strong priority effects, and hence multiple community states, only emerged for the species pool with the greatest phylogenetic relatedness. Community assembly also resulted in a significant positive relationship between bacterial phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem functions. Interestingly, these results emerged despite a lack of phylogenetic conservatism for most of the bacterial functional traits considered. Our results highlight the utility of phylogenetic information for understanding the structure and functioning of ecological communities, even when phylogenetically conserved functional traits are not identified or measured.},

An abundance of weakly interacting species increases stability in natural systems, suggesting that loss of weakly linked species may reduce stability. Any link between the functional uniqueness of a species and the strength of its interactions in a food web could therefore have simultaneous effects on ecosystem functioning and stability. Here, we analyse patterns in 213 real food webs and show that highly unique species consistently tend to have the weakest mean interaction strength per unit biomass in the system. This relationship is not a simple consequence of the interdependence of both measures on body size and appears to be driven by the empirical pattern of size structuring in aquatic systems and the trophic position of each species in the web. Food web resolution also has an important effect, with aggregation of species into higher taxonomic groups producing a much weaker relationship. Food webs with fewer unique and less weakly interacting species also show significantly greater variability in their levels of primary production. Thus, the loss of highly unique, weakly interacting species may eventually lead to dramatic state changes and unpredictable levels of ecosystem functioning.},

Restoration or maintenance of the connectivity by gene flow between the fragmented patches may be determinant to sustaining viable populations, especially for insect-pollinated species. Functional biological corridors facilitating pollen flow between remnants in a human-dominated matrix might achieve this. 2. Dye dispersal was investigated for the extremely fragmented insect-pollinated herb Primula vulgaris, using fluorescent dye particles as pollen analogues, in a study site comprising 20 populations, of which 13 pairs were physically connected by a linear landscape elements (LLEs, ditches), and 11 pairs were not connected by an LLE. The dye deposition events were used to fit a model of pollen dispersal at the landscape level. We examined whether existing LLEs in the intensively used agricultural landscape act as functional corridors for pollen dispersal. The effects of LLE length and size and plant density of the recipient population on the dispersal patterns were tested. 3. Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with 80\% of the dye transfers occurring at less than 85.1 m, and a maximal distance of 1010.8 m. The mean distance travelled by fluorescent dye particles based on the dye dispersal model was δ = 87 m. 4. Dye dispersal between populations was found to be significantly higher when populations were connected by an LLE, than when populations were unconnected. For the group of population pairs connected by an LLE, dye deposition significantly decreased with the distance to dye source, but was not related to recipient population size and plant density. 5. Synthesis. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that existing LLEs in an intensively used farmland may act as functional biological corridors facilitating pollen dispersal through pollinator movements. The maintenance or restoration of a network of populations connected by LLEs, but also by other landscape structures (e.g. population relays in vegetation patches and networks of small elements allowing indirect connections) should be strongly encouraged.},

We then estimated phylogenetic relationships using molecular data from three gene sequences available on GenBank (matK, rbcL and ITS1). We tested for phylogenetic signals in occupancy using Blomberg's K. Results  Whereas most non-native plants were relatively scarce, there was a strong phylogenetic signal for continental occupancy, driven by the clustering of successful species in Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. However, we failed to detect a phylogenetic signal at the park scale. Main Conclusions  Our results reveal that at a large spatial scale, invader success is phylogenetically clustered where ecological traits promoting success appear to be shared among close relatives, indicating that phylogenetic relationships can be useful predictors of invasion success at large spatial scales. At a smaller, landscape scale, there was no evidence of phylogenetic clustering of invasion success, and thus, relatedness plays a much reduced role in determining the relative success of invaders.},

	abstract = {A longstanding concept in community ecology is that closely related species compete more strongly than distant relatives. Ecologists have invoked this “limiting similarity hypothesis” to explain patterns in the structure and function of biological communities and to inform conservation, restoration, and invasive-species management. However, few studies have empirically tested the validity of the limiting similarity hypothesis. Here we report the results of a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we used a model system of 23 common, co-occurring North American freshwater green algae to quantify the strength of 216 pairwise species' interactions (the difference in population density when grown alone vs. in the presence of another species) along a manipulated gradient of evolutionary relatedness (phylogenetic distance, as the sum of branch lengths separating species on a molecular phylogeny). Interspecific interactions varied widely in these bicultures of phytoplankton, ranging from strong competition (ratio of relative yield in polyculture vs.  monoculture ≪ 1) to moderate facilitation (relative yield {\textgreater}1). Yet, we found no evidence that the strength of species' interactions was influenced by their evolutionary relatedness. There was no relationship between phylogenetic distance and the average, minimum (inferior competitor), nor maximum (superior competitor) interaction strength across all biculture communities (respectively, P = 0.19, P = 0.17, P = 0.14; N = 428). When we examined each individual species, only 17\% of individual species' interactions strengths varied as a function of phylogenetic distance, and none of these relationships remained significant after Bonferoni correction for multiple tests (N = 23). Last, when we grouped interactions into five qualitatively different types, the frequency of these types was not related to phylogenetic distance among species pairs (F4, 422 = 1.63, P = 0.15). Our empirical study adds to several others that suggest the biological underpinnings of competition may not be evolutionarily conserved, and thus, ecologists may need to re-evaluate the previously assumed generality of the limiting similarity hypothesis.},

The science and practice of restoration ecology, in collaboration with other disciplines, can contribute to overcoming these challenges. This endeavor requires a solid conceptual foundation based in empirical research which confronts, tests and influences theoretical developments. We review conceptual developments in restoration ecology over the last 30 years. We frame our review in the context of changing restoration goals which reflect increased societal awareness of the scale of environmental degradation and the recognition that inter-disciplinary approaches are needed to tackle environmental problems. Restoration ecology now encompasses facilitative interactions and network dynamics, trophic cascades, and above- and belowground linkages. It operates in a non-equilibrium, alternative states framework, at the landscape scale, and in response to changing environmental, economic and social conditions. Progress has been marked by conceptual advances in the fields of trait-environment relationships, community assembly, and understanding the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Conceptual and practical advances have been enhanced by applying evolving technologies, including treatments to increase seed germination and overcome recruitment bottlenecks, high throughput DNA sequencing to elucidate soil community structure and function, and advances in satellite technology and GPS tracking to monitor habitat use. The synthesis of these technologies with systematic reviews of context dependencies in restoration success, model based analyses and consideration of complex socio-ecological systems will allow generalizations to inform evidence based interventions. Ongoing challenges include setting realistic, socially acceptable goals for restoration under changing environmental conditions, and prioritizing actions in an increasingly space-competitive world. Ethical questions also surround the use of genetically modified material, translocations, taxon substitutions, and de-extinction, in restoration ecology. Addressing these issues, as the Ecological Society of America looks to its next century, will require current and future generations of researchers and practitioners, including economists, engineers, philosophers, landscape architects, social scientists and restoration ecologists, to work together with communities and governments to rise to the environmental challenges of the coming decades.},

This index has been the subject of a strong debate concerning the choice of the distance and the clustering method to be used, since the method chosen may greatly affect the FD values obtained. Much of this debate has been centred around which method of dendrogram construction gives a faithful representation of species distribution in multidimensional functional trait space. From artificially generated datasets varying in species richness and correlations between traits, we test whether any single combination of clustering method(s) and distance consistently produces a dendrogram that most closely corresponds to the matrix of functional distances between pairs of species studied. We also test the ability of consensus trees, which incorporate features common to a range of different dendrograms, to summarize distance matrices. Our results show that no combination of clustering method(s) and distance constantly outperforms the others due to the complexity of interactions between correlations of traits, species richness, distance measures and clustering methods. Furthermore, the construction of a consensus tree from a range of dendrograms is often the best solution. Consequently, we recommend testing all combinations of distances and clustering methods (including consensus trees), then selecting the most reliable tree (with the lowest dissimilarity) to estimate FD value. Furthermore we suggest that any index that requires the construction of functional dendrograms potentially benefits from this new approach.},

Introduced and extinct species did not have equivalent functional roles nor belong to similar lineages.

Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis, one of the oldest hypotheses in invasion biology, emphasizes the importance of phylogenetic relatedness (PR) between resident and invader species for predicting invasibility. Alternatively, a recent extension of the diversity-invasibility hypothesis predicts that phylogenetic diversity (PD) of resident communities influences invasibility. Neither of these hypotheses has undergone rigorous experimental testing, and the relative contributions of PR and PD to community invasibility are unknown, in part because their effects tend to be confounded with each other. Here we consider both perspectives together by independently manipulating PR and PD in laboratory bacterial assemblages. We found that, although invader abundance decreased significantly as PR increased, it was unaffected by PD. Likewise, we found that resident-invader functional similarity, not functional diversity of resident communities, was a significant predictor of invader abundance. Nevertheless, invader abundance was better predicted by PR than by functional similarity. These results highlight the importance of considering species evolutionary relationships, especially the PR between resident and invader species, for the prediction, prevention, and management of biological invasions.},

This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.},

Previous studies focusing on single snapshots of invasion patterns have provided support to both sides of the conundrum. Here, by examining invasion dynamics of 480 plots over 40 years, we show that exotic species more closely related to native species were more likely to enter, establish and dominate the resident communities, and that native residents more closely related to these successful exotics were more likely to go locally extinct. Therefore, non-random displacement of natives during invasion could weaken or even reverse the negative effects of exotic–native phylogenetic distances on invasion success. The scenario that exotics more closely related to native residents are more successful, but tend to eliminate their closely related natives, may help to reconcile the 150-year-old conundrum.},

	abstract = {* Identifying the factors determining the success of invasive species is critical for management of biological invasions. Darwin's naturalization conundrum states that exotic species closely related to natives should be successful because of a shared affinity for local environmental conditions, but at the same time close relatives often compete more intensively, limiting ‘niche’ opportunities for the invaders. Previous studies have generally considered these two ‘opposing’ hypotheses as mutually exclusive, yet evidence for both of them abounds, indicating a practical dilemma for management of biological invasions.


* In this study, we sowed the seeds of the invasive exotic Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. into 369 experimental plant communities to mimic an introduction of the exotics into a series of new habitats. We further linked the establishment and growth performance of the invader in these experimental communities to the phylogenetic relatedness between the invader and the community residents where it was introduced.


* We found that the probability of invader establishment declined with increasing phylogenetic distance between the invader and residents, whereas the average size of surviving invader individuals increased with the phylogenetic distance.


* These results can be at least partly explained by the observations that close relatives tend to create similar soil microhabitat through harbouring similar soil enzymes (e.g. alkaline and acid phosphatases) benefiting invader establishment and that intense competitive interactions between the invader and its close relatives suppressed exotic growth.


* Synthesis and applications. This study presents the first experimental evidence that phylogenetic relatedness has contrasting effects on different aspects of invader success, thus shedding light on the long-standing Darwin's naturalization conundrum. Moreover, our findings also have important implications for management of plant invasions: for controlling invasive species characterized by high establishment probability, native species distantly related to the invasive species can be planted in sites surrounding the invasion foci, whereas the opposite seems to be true for controlling those characterized by large individual size.},

The large number of disparate metrics used to quantify functional diversity reflects the range of attributes underlying this concept, generally summarized as functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence. However, in practice, we know very little about which attributes drive which ecosystem functions, due to a lack of field-based tests. Here we test the association between eight leading functional diversity metrics (Rao’s Q, FD, FDis, FEve, FDiv, convex hull volume, and species and functional group richness) that emphasize different attributes of functional diversity, plus 11 extensions of these existing metrics that incorporate heterogeneous species abundances and trait variation. We assess the relationships among these metrics and compare their performances for predicting three key ecosystem functions (above- and belowground biomass and light capture) within a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Many metrics were highly correlated, although unique information was captured in FEve, FDiv, and dendrogram-based measures (FD) that were adjusted by abundance. FD adjusted by abundance outperformed all other metrics in predicting both above- and belowground biomass, although several others also performed well (e.g. Rao’s Q, FDis, FDiv). More generally, trait-based richness metrics and hybrid metrics incorporating multiple diversity attributes outperformed evenness metrics and single-attribute metrics, results that were not changed when combinations of metrics were explored. For light capture, species richness alone was the best predictor, suggesting that traits for canopy architecture would be necessary to improve predictions. Our study provides a comprehensive test linking different attributes of functional diversity with ecosystem function for a grassland system.},

Yet, two main criticisms have been levelled at (dis)similarity coefficients. First, few developments include information on species' abundances, and either phylogeny or functional traits. Secondly, some (dis)similarity coefficients fail to always provide maximum dissimilarity between two completely distinct communities, that is, communities without common species and with zero similarities among their species.


* Here, we introduce a new family of similarity coefficients responding to these criticisms. Within this family, we concentrate on four coefficients and compare them to Rao's dissimilarity on macroinvertebrate communities, and simulated data.


* Our new coefficients correctly treat maximally dissimilar communities: similarities are always zero between two completely distinct communities. The originality of these new coefficients is even more profound as the existence of maximally dissimilar communities was not a requirement for the new coefficients to behave differently than Rao's dissimilarity coefficient.


* Our new family of similarity coefficients relies on the abundances or occurrences of species within communities and on phylogenetic, taxonomic or functional similarities among species. We demonstrate that this new family embeds many of the recent developments in both functional and phylogenetic diversity.

	abstract = {* Significant advances in both mathematical and molecular approaches in ecology offer unprecedented opportunities to describe and understand ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks describe interactions between species, the underlying structure of communities and the function and stability of ecosystems. They provide the ability to assess the robustness of complex ecological communities to species loss, as well as a novel way of guiding restoration. However, empirically quantifying the interactions between entire communities remains a significant challenge.


* Concomitantly, advances in DNA sequencing technologies are resolving previously intractable questions in functional and taxonomic biodiversity and provide enormous potential to determine hitherto difficult to observe species interactions. Combining DNA metabarcoding approaches with ecological network analysis presents important new opportunities for understanding large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as providing powerful tools for building ecosystems that are resilient to environmental change.


* We propose a novel ‘nested tagging’ metabarcoding approach for the rapid construction of large, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks. Taking tree–insect–parasitoid ecological networks as an illustration, we show how measures of network robustness, constructed using DNA metabarcoding, can be used to determine the consequences of tree species loss within forests, and forest habitat loss within wider landscapes. By determining which species and habitats are important to network integrity, we propose new directions for forest management.


* Merging metabarcoding with ecological network analysis provides a revolutionary opportunity to construct some of the largest, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks to date, providing new ways to: (i) monitor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; (ii) assess the robustness of interacting communities to species loss; and (iii) build ecosystems that are more resilient to environmental change.

	abstract = {Coextinction models are useful to understand community robustness to species loss and resilience to disturbances. We simulated pollinator extinctions in pollination networks by using a hybrid model that combined a recently developed stochastic coextinction model (SCM) for plant extinctions and a topological model (TCM) for animal extinctions. Our model accounted for variation in interaction strengths and included empirical estimates of plant dependence on pollinators to set seeds. The stochastic nature of such model allowed us determining plant survival to single (and multiple) extinction events, and identifying which pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger secondary extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal sequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant survival was more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by interaction strength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants were the most sensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in extinction cascades. We predict that the relationship between dependence and plant connectivity is crucial to determine network robustness to interaction loss. Finally, we showed that honeybees and several beetles were keystone species in our communities. This information is of great value to foresee consequences of pollinator losses facing current global change and to identify target species for effective conservation.},

There has been an urgent call for conservation and restoration of the degraded lands previously occupied by TDFs. Restoration experiences aim to recover species diversity and ecological functions. Different restoration strategies have been used to maximize plant performance including weeding, planting or using artificial mulching. In this investigation, we evaluated whether different restoration practices influence animal arrival and the reestablishment of biotic interactions. We particularly evaluated lepidopteran larvae diversity and caterpillar predation on plants established under different restoration treatments (mulching, weeding and control) in the Pacific West Coast of México. This study corroborated the importance of plant host identity for lepidopteran presence in a particular area. Lepidopteran diversity and herbivory rates were not affected by the restoration treatment but they were related to tree species. In contrast, caterpillar predation marks were affected by restoration treatment, with a greater number of predation marks in control plots, while caterpillar predation marks among plant species were not significantly different. This study highlights the importance of considering the introduction of high plant species diversity when planning TDF restoration to maximize lepidopteran diversity and ecosystem functioning.},

Compartments have been difficult to detect in empirical food webs because of incompatible approaches or insufficient methodological rigour. Here we show that a method for detecting compartments from the social networking science identified significant compartments in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments. The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping compartments, assigns membership to compartments, and tests the statistical significance of the results. A graphical presentation reveals systemic relationships and taxa-specific positions as structured by compartments. From this graphic, we explore two scenarios of disturbance to develop a hypothesis for testing how compartmentalized interactions increase stability in food webs.},

Here, I evaluate successes and failures in restoration, how science is informing these efforts, and ways to better address decision-making and policy needs. Despite the multitude of restoration projects and wide agreement that evaluation is a key to future progress, comprehensive evaluations are rare. Based on the limited available information, restoration outcomes vary widely. Cases of complete recovery are frequently characterized by the persistence of species and abiotic processes that permit natural regeneration. Incomplete recovery is often attributed to a mixture of local and landscape constraints, including shifts in species distributions and legacies of past land use. Lastly, strong species feedbacks and regional shifts in species pools and climate can result in little to no recovery. More forward-looking paradigms, such as enhancing ecosystem services and increasing resilience to future change, are exciting new directions that need more assessment. Increased evidence-based evaluation and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer will better inform a wide range of critical restoration issues such as how to prioritize sites and interventions, include uncertainty in decision making, incorporate temporal and spatial dependencies, and standardize outcome assessments. As environmental policy increasingly embraces restoration, the opportunities have never been greater.},

The most influential hypothesis, the resource concentration hypothesis, predicts only positive density–area relations, as a consequence of different emigration and immigration rates in small and large patches, and empirical deviations have inspired a flurry of alternative explanations. In this paper, we use realistic rules for the relationship between patch size and migration rates and show a wider predictive range for density–area relations than previously believed. Comparisons with published data suggest that observed density–area relations may easily fit in a framework based on a minimum set of behavioural and population processes. This does not imply that other mechanisms are unimportant, but merely that their quantitative importance can only be evaluated relative to patch geometry and local growth.},

	abstract = {The degree to which biotic interactions influence invasion by non-indigenous species may be partly explained by the evolutionary relationship of these invaders with natives. Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis controversially proposes that non-native plants are more likely to invade if they lack close relatives in their new range. A possible mechanism for this pattern is that exotics that are more closely related to natives are more likely to share their herbivores, and thus will suffer more damage than phylogenetically isolated species. We tested this prediction using exotic plants in Ontario, Canada. We measured herbivore damage to 32 species of exotic plants in a common garden experiment, and 52 in natural populations. We estimated their phylogenetic distances from locally occurring natives in three ways: as mean distance (age) to all native plants, mean distance to native members of the same family, and distance to the closest native species. In the common garden, the proportion of leaves damaged and the average proportion of leaf area damaged declined with mean phylogenetic distance to native family relatives by late summer. Distance to native confamilials was a better predictor of damage than distance to the closest native species, while mean distance to the entire native plant community failed to predict damage. No significant patterns were detected for plants in natural populations, likely because uncontrolled site-to-site variation concealed these phylogenetic trends. To the extent that herbivory has negative demographic impacts, these results suggest that exotics that are more phylogenetically isolated from native confamilials should be more invasive; conversely, native communities should be more resistant to invasion if they harbor close familial relatives of potential invaders. However, the large scatter in this relationship suggests that these often are likely to be weak effects; as a result, these effects often may be difficult to detect in uncontrolled surveys of natural populations.},

	abstract = {* Neighbouring resources have been found to either decrease or increase the likelihood that a consumer organism attacks a focal resource. These phenomena are referred to as associational resistance (AR) and associational susceptibility (AS), respectively. While associational effects have been observed in various field studies, little is known on how resource heterogeneity can cause associational effects.


* We used a laboratory approach in which we studied the effects of resource density and frequency in the search behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for olfactory-guided behaviour in insects. We first determined whether D. melanogaster could discriminate between odour sources that differ quantitatively. Secondly, we determined what the effect of resource density and frequency was on the search behaviour of D. melanogaster by combining these resources into various patch arrangements. Finally, we used the outcome of our experiments to disentangle the role of resource density and frequency in associational effects.


* We found that D. melanogaster has the ability to discriminate between quantitatively different resources, but that the attraction to resource density is constrained by an optimum after which attraction decreases. Furthermore, in heterogeneous environments, flies showed a strong preference towards the more apparent resource, leading to AS for the more apparent resources and AR for the less apparent resource. The strength of this interaction increased with a decreasing frequency of the more apparent resource.


* These results imply that D. melanogaster mainly selects patches at the level of individual resources. Consequently, when a patch contains qualitatively different resources, the more apparent resource will attract a higher number of flies than the less apparent resource irrespective of the frequency of the apparent resource within the patch.


* Our study shows that associational effects can be explained by determining the hierarchical level at which a consumer selects its resources. When a consumer selects resources at the individual level rather than at the patch level, our results can be used to explain the population dynamics of host plants and their associated consumers under field conditions.

Mechanistic models that explain the observed variety of herbivore responses to local plant community composition have, however, been lacking. We present a model of herbivore responses to patches that consist of two plant types, where herbivore densities on a focal plant are determined by a combination of patch-finding, within-patch redistribution, and patch-leaving. Our analyses show that the effect of plant neighborhood on herbivores depends both on how plant and herbivore traits combine to affect herbivore movement and on how experimental designs reveal the effects of plant density and plant relative frequency. Associational susceptibility should be the dominant pattern when herbivores have biased landing rates within patches. Other behavioral decision rules lead to mixed responses, but a common pattern is that in mixed patches, one plant type experiences associational resistance while the other plant experiences associational susceptibility. In some cases, the associational effect may shift sign along a gradient of plant frequency, suggesting that future empirical studies should include more than two plant frequencies to detect nonlinearities. Finally, we find that associational susceptibility should be commonly observed in experiments using replacement designs, whereas associational resistance will be the dominant pattern when using additive designs. Consequently, outcomes from one experimental design cannot be directly compared to studies with other designs. Our model can also be translated to other systems with foragers searching for multiple resource types.},

These effects are predicted to result from mismatches experienced by the consumer organism in resource selection along hierarchical search levels. As resource selection depends on sensory information used during search behaviour, we expected that different physiological states of an insect might modulate the outcome of associational effects due to differences in resource selection. We used Drosophila melanogaster, as a model organism for olfactory-guided behaviour in insects, to study the effects of mating induced behavioural changes on associational effects between two alternative resources. We found that mating has no effect on the ability of D. melanogaster to locate resource patches, but rather affects the perception of the resources within the patch. Consequently, we only found associational effects in the experiments with unmated females and not in the experiments with mated females. Our results suggest that the lack of associational effects for mated females resulted from changes in the use of short-range olfactory cues, leading to random selection among the resources. In conclusion, our results suggest that the physiological state of an insect modulates associational effects by affecting resource selection rates within the patch.},

It is therefore important to understand the observed variability among species responses to fragmentation and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we compare density–area relationships (DARs) for 344 lepidopteran species belonging to 22 families (butterflies and moths). This analysis suggested that the DARslope is generally positive for moths and negative for butterflies. The differences are suggested to occur because moths are largely olfactory searchers, whereas most butterflies are visual searchers. The analysis also suggests that DARs vary as a function of habitat specialization and body size. In butterflies, generalist species had a more negative DARslope than specialist species because of a lower patch size threshold. In moths, the differences in DARslope between forest and open habitat species were large for small species but absent for large species. This difference is argued to occur because the DARslope in large species mainly reflects their search mode, which does not necessarily vary between moth groups, whereas the slope in small species reflects population growth rates.},

Using a mathematical model, predictions of scale-dependent immigration and emigration rates for insects into patches with different densities of host plants were derived. Moreover, a field experiment was conducted where the scaling properties of odour-mediated attraction in relation to the number of odour sources were estimated, in order to derive a prediction of immigration rates of olfactory searchers. The theoretical model predicted that we should expect immigration rates of contact and visual searchers to be determined by patch area, with a steep scaling coefficient, μ = −1. The field experiment suggested that olfactory searchers should show a less steep scaling coefficient, with μ ≈ −0.5. A parameter estimation and analysis of published data revealed a correspondence between observations and predictions, and density-variation among groups could largely be explained by search behaviour. Aphids showed scaling coefficients corresponding to the prediction for contact/visual searchers, whereas moths, flies and beetles corresponded to the prediction for olfactory searchers. As density responses varied considerably among groups, and variation could be explained by a certain trait, we conclude that a general theory of insect responses to habitat heterogeneity should be based on shared traits, rather than a general prediction for all species.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Plant communities vary tremendously in terms of productivity, species diversity, and genetic diversity within species. This vegetation heterogeneity can impact both the likelihood and strength of interactions between plants and insect herbivores. Because altering plant‐herbivore interactions will likely impact the fitness of both partners, these ecological effects also have evolutionary consequences. We review several hypothesized and well‐documented mechanisms whereby variation in the plant community alters the plant‐herbivore interaction, discuss potential evolutionary outcomes of each of these ecological effects, and conclude by highlighting several avenues for future research. The underlying theme of this review is that the neighborhood of plants is an important determinant of insect attack, and this results in feedback effects on the plant community. Because plants exert selection on herbivore traits and, reciprocally, herbivores exert selection on plant‐defense traits, variation in the plant community likely contributes to spatial and temporal variation in both plant and insect traits, which could influence macroevolutionary patterns.},

	abstract = {When searching for resources in heterogeneous environments, animals must rely on their abilities to detect the resources via their sensory systems. However, variation in the strength of the sensory cue may be mediated by the physical size of the resource patch. Patch detection of insects are often predicted by the scaling of sensory cues to patch size, where visual cues has been proposed to scale proportional to the diameter of the patch. The scaling properties of olfactory cues are, however, virtually unknown. Here, we investigated scaling rules for olfactory information in a gradient of numbers of odour sources, relevant to odour-mediated attraction under field conditions. We recorded moth antennal responses to sex pheromones downwind from pheromone patches and estimated the slope in the scaling relationship between the effective length of the odour plumes and the number of odour sources. These measurements showed that the effective plume length increased proportional to the square root of the number of odour sources. The scaling relationship, as estimated in the field experiment, was then evaluated against field data of the slope in the relationship between trap catch and release rate of chemical attractants for a wide range of insects. This meta-analysis revealed an average slope largely consistent with the estimated scaling relationship between the effective plume length and the number of odour sources. This study is the first to estimate the scaling properties of olfactory cues empirically and has implications for understanding and predicting the spatial distributions of insects searching by means of olfactory cues in heterogeneous environments.},

	abstract = {Associational resistance occurs when herbivore damage to a focal plant is reduced by the presence of other plant species. Neighboring plants can reduce herbivore damage (1) by their effects on the predator community, (2) by reducing the ability of herbivores to find their host plants, and (3) by reducing the time herbivores remain on their host plants. We examined how the presence of the aromatic low shrub Myrica gale and of predatory lady beetles affected herbivore damage and reproductive output in a population of the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria in northern Sweden. An observational study showed that L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets were less damaged by herbivores, had a lower abundance of the monophagous, leaf-feeding, chrysomelid beetle Galerucella calmariensis, and had higher flower and seed production than L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. To test whether these differences could be explained by (a) differences in some aspect of plant quality, or (b) differences in predator abundance, we placed potted L. salicaria within and outside Myrica thickets. To determine whether differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were primarily the result of different rates of colonization or emigration, we marked adult beetles and placed them on a second set of potted plants in the two microhabitats. The results show that differences in herbivore abundance, plant damage, and reproductive output between potted L. salicaria placed within and outside Myrica thickets were in the same direction and of the same magnitude as those observed for naturally occurring plants, indicating that the observed patterns were not an effect of differences in the chemical composition of the host plant. Moreover, we found no support for the hypothesis that a higher abundance of insect predators could explain the lower abundance of G. calmariensis on L. salicaria in Myrica thickets. On the contrary, lady beetles (Coccinella quinqempunctata and Coccinella septempunctata) were observed on a greater proportion of the plants placed outside the Myrica thickets. The monitoring of marked beetles indicated that differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were the result of a markedly higher colonization rate and a somewhat lower emigration rate from L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. Outside the Myrica thickets, the survival of G. calmariensis and the magnitude of herbivore damage were lower, and fruit and seed output were higher on plants with observations of lady beetles than on plants without lady beetles. The results indicate that the abundance of the specialist herbivore G. calmariensis, and the herbivore damage and reproductive output of its host plant, L. salicaria, are affected both by the presence of the nonhost Myrica and by predation from lady beetles. We suggest that the most likely mechanism causing decreased feeding on L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets is that Myrica affects the ability of G. calmariensis to find its host, either through visual or olfactory interference.},

However, it has recently been suggested that close relatedness may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of eusociality. We tested this idea with a comparative analysis of female mating frequencies in 267 species of eusocial bees, wasps, and ants. We found that mating with a single male, which maximizes relatedness, is ancestral for all eight independent eusocial lineages that we investigated. Mating with multiple males is always derived. Furthermore, we found that high polyandry ({\textgreater}2 effective mates) occurs only in lineages whose workers have lost reproductive totipotency. These results provide the first evidence that monogamy was critical in the evolution of eusociality, strongly supporting the prediction of inclusive fitness theory.
Monogamy prevailed in the ancestral lineages of bees and wasps, suggesting that high relatedness was critical to the evolution of their complex, cooperative social systems.

Null models are a way of addressing these questions, helping to distinguish patterns driven by neutral mechanisms or sampling effects (e.g. relative abundance of different taxa, sampling completeness) from deterministic biological mechanisms (e.g. resource selection and avoidance), but few “off the shelf” tools are available.


* We present econullnetr, an r package combining null modelling and plotting functions for networks, with data-export tools to facilitate its use alongside existing network analysis packages. It models resource choices made by individual consumers, enabling it to capture individual-level heterogeneity and generalising to a wider range of data types and scenarios than models applied directly to network matrices. The outputs can be analysed from the level of individual links to whole networks.

Because of their overall complexity, an intriguing approach to understanding network structure is by breaking it down into the structural roles of its constituent species. The structural role of a species can be directly measured based on how it appears in network motifs – the basic building blocks of complex networks. Here, we study the distribution of species’ roles at three distinct spatio-temporal scales (i.e. species, network, and temporal) in host–parasitoid networks collected across 22 sites over two years within a fragmented landscape of oaks in southern Finland. We found that species’ roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously distributed across the study system but that roles are strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found that species’ roles were remarkably consistent between years even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover). Overall, our results suggest that species’ roles are an intrinsic property of species that may be predictable over spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {* Empirical studies have found that the mutualistic interactions forming the structure of plant–pollinator networks are typically more nested than expected by chance alone. Additionally, theoretical studies have shown a positive association between the nested structure of mutualistic networks and community persistence. Yet, it has been shown that some plant–pollinator networks may be more nested than others, raising the interesting question of which factors are responsible for such enhanced nested structure.


* It has been argued that ordered network structures may increase the persistence of ecological communities under less predictable environments. This suggests that nested structures of plant–pollinator networks could be more advantageous under highly seasonal environments. While several studies have investigated the link between nestedness and various environmental variables, unfortunately, there has been no unified answer to validate these predictions. Here, we move from the problem of describing network structures to the problem of comparing network structures. We develop comparative statistics, and apply them to investigate the association between the nested structure of 59 plant–pollinator networks and the temperature seasonality present in their locations.


* We demonstrate that higher levels of nestedness are associated with a higher temperature seasonality. We show that the previous lack of agreement came from an extended practice of using standardized measures of nestedness that cannot be compared across different networks.


* Importantly, our observations complement theory showing that more nested network structures can increase the range of environmental conditions compatible with species coexistence in mutualistic systems, also known as structural stability. This increase in nestedness should be more advantageous and occur more often in locations subject to random environmental perturbations, which could be driven by highly changing or seasonal environments. This synthesis of theory and observations could prove relevant for a better understanding of the ecological processes driving the assembly and persistence of ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Species interactions are traditionally seen as the outcome of both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. Among them, the two most frequently studied are the neutral role of species abundances in determining encounter probability and the deterministic role of species identity (traits and evolutionary history) in determining the compatibility of interacting. Nevertheless, the occurrence of pairwise interactions also depends on the spatio-temporal context imposed by the ecological neighborhood (i.e. the indirect effect of other local species sharing traits and interaction potential with the focal ones). Although a few studies have begun to examine neighborhood effects on community interactions, these have not incorporated neighborhood structure as a complementary driver of pairwise interactions within an integrative approach. Here we describe the spatial structure of pairwise interactions between three fleshy-fruited tree species and six frugivorous thrush species within the same locality of the Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula). Using a spatio-temporally fine-grained dataset sampled during three years, we aimed to detect spatial patterns of interactions and to evaluate their concordance across years. We also evaluated the simultaneous roles played by species abundance, species identity and the ecological neighborhood in determining the pairwise interaction frequencies based on fruit removal. Our results showed that the abundances of fruit and bird species involved in plant-frugivore interactions, and the spatial patterns of these interactions, varied among years, and this was mainly due to different fruiting landscapes responding to masting events of distinct plant species. Despite high interannual differences in species abundances and the pairwise interaction frequencies, the main mechanisms underpinning the occurrence of pairwise interactions remained constant. Most of the variability in pairwise interactions was always explained by interacting fruit and bird species’ abundances. Ecological neighborhood, characterized as the net quantity of forest cover, heterospecific fruit crops, and heterospecific bird abundances in the immediate surroundings, also affected pairwise interaction frequency through its indirect effects on the abundance of interacting bird species. Our results highlight the prevalence of neutral forces in highly generalized plant-frugivore assemblages as well as the influence of indirect interactions (competition and/or facilitation with other local species) as another important driver to consider when predicting pairwise interactions.},

We show that such selected intervals fail to provide the assumed coverage probability. By generalizing the false discovery rate (FDR) approach from multiple testing to selected multiple CIs, we suggest the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) as a measure of interval coverage following selection. A general procedure is then introduced, offering FCR control at level q under any selection rule. The procedure constructs a marginal CI for each selected parameter, but instead of the confidence level 1 − q being used marginally, q is divided by the number of parameters considered and multiplied by the number selected. If we further use the FDR controlling testing procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg for selecting the parameters, the newly suggested procedure offers CIs that are dual to the testing procedure and are shown to be optimal in the independent case. Under the positive regression dependency condition of Benjamini and Yekutieli, the FCR is controlled for one-sided tests and CIs, as well as for a modification for two-sided testing. Results for general dependency are also given. Finally, using the equivalence of the CIs to testing, we prove that the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg offers directional FDR control as conjectured.},

	abstract = {* Although agriculture is amongst the world's most widespread land uses, studies of its effects on stream ecosystems are often limited in spatial extent. National monitoring data could extend spatial coverage and increase statistical power, but present analytical challenges where covarying environmental variables confound relationships of interest.


* Propensity modelling is used widely outside ecology to control for confounding variables in observational data. Here, monitoring data from over 3000 English and Welsh river reaches are used to assess the effects of intensive agricultural land cover (arable and pastoral) on stream habitat, water chemistry and invertebrates, using propensity scores to control for potential confounding factors (e.g. climate, geology). Propensity scoring effectively reduced the collinearity between land cover and potential confounding variables, reducing the potential for covariate bias in estimated treatment–response relationships compared to conventional multiple regression.


* Macroinvertebrate richness was significantly greater at sites with a higher proportion of improved pasture in their catchment or riparian zone, with these effects probably mediated by increased algal production from mild nutrient enrichment. In contrast, macroinvertebrate richness did not change with arable land cover, although sensitive species representation was lower under higher proportions of arable land cover, probably due to greatly elevated nutrient concentrations.


* Synthesis and applications. Propensity modelling has great potential to address questions about pressures on ecosystems and organisms at the large spatial extents relevant to land-use policy, where experimental approaches are not feasible and broad environmental changes often covary. Applied to the effects of agricultural land cover on stream systems, this approach identified reduced nutrient loading from arable farms as a priority for land management. On this specific issue, our data and analysis support the use of riparian or catchment-scale measures to reduce nutrient delivery to sensitive water bodies.},

Increased efforts are needed from both researchers and policy makers to engage from the earliest stage possible in the identification, assessment and communication of environmental issues and possible management solutions. Narrowing the gap between research and policy is essential if the academic community is to capitalize effectively on recent governmental investments in research and provide the necessary evidence basis for reconciling agricultural production and environmental conservation in Brazil.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

	abstract = {* In 2003, 24 presence–absence β-diversity metrics were reviewed and a number of trade-offs and redundancies identified. We present a parallel investigation into the performance of abundance-based metrics of β-diversity.


* β-diversity is a multi-faceted concept, central to spatial ecology. There are multiple metrics available to quantify it: the choice of metric is an important decision.


* We test 16 conceptual properties and two sampling properties of a β-diversity metric: metrics should be 1) independent of α-diversity and 2) cumulative along a gradient of species turnover. Similarity should be 3) probabilistic when assemblages are independently and identically distributed. Metrics should have 4) a minimum of zero and increase monotonically with the degree of 5) species turnover, 6) decoupling of species ranks and 7) evenness differences. However, complete species turnover should always generate greater values of β than extreme 8) rank shifts or 9) evenness differences. Metrics should 10) have a fixed upper limit, 11) symmetry (βA,B = βB,A), 12) double-zero asymmetry for double absences and double presences and 13) not decrease in a series of nested assemblages. Additionally, metrics should be independent of 14) species replication 15) the units of abundance and 16) differences in total abundance between sampling units. When samples are used to infer β-diversity, metrics should be 1) independent of sample sizes and 2) independent of unequal sample sizes. We test 29 metrics for these properties and five ‘personality’ properties.


* Thirteen metrics were outperformed or equalled across all conceptual and sampling properties. Differences in sensitivity to species’ abundance lead to a performance trade-off between sample size bias and the ability to detect turnover among rare species. In general, abundance-based metrics are substantially less biased in the face of undersampling, although the presence–absence metric, βsim, performed well overall. Only βBaselga R turn, βBaselga B-C turn and βsim measured purely species turnover and were independent of nestedness. Among the other metrics, sensitivity to nestedness varied {\textgreater}4-fold.


* Our results indicate large amounts of redundancy among existing β-diversity metrics, whilst the estimation of unseen shared and unshared species is lacking and should be addressed in the design of new abundance-based metrics.},

The study of social behaviour of these species involved, as a general procedure, the identification of each associated female in relation to its foraging and reproductive activity. It was observed that in each species the association of females started at the final phase of the biological cycle, when the reactivation of the nests began. Initially the association was observed to occur among mother and daughters. Subsequently only daughters remained in the nest and in the first phase of this association only one female (generally the eldest), was able to realize oviposition. Next, two ore more females were in the same condition, provisioning and ovipositing in only one cell. In the third phase the females had all the same condition, each one of them provisioning and ovipositing in their own cells. So, in the first and second phases the social behaviour corresponds to the semisocial and quasisocial levels, respectively. Nevertheless, this behaviour was transitory and the final pattern attained was communal.},

The entire data set consisted of 3,421 aligned nucleotide sites, 854 of which were parsimony informative. Analyses by equal weights parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods yielded good resolution among the 53 taxa/populations, with strong bootstrap support and high posterior probabilities for most nodes. There was no significant incongruence among genes, and parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods yielded congruent results. We mapped social behavior onto the resulting tree for 42 of the taxa/populations to infer the likely history of social evolution within Lasioglossum. Our results indicate that eusociality had a single origin within Lasioglossum. Within the predominantly eusocial clade, however, there have been multiple (six) reversals from eusociality to solitary nesting, social polymorphism, or social parasitism, suggesting that these reversals may be more common in primitively eusocial Hymenoptera than previously anticipated. Our results support the view that eusociality is hard to evolve but easily lost. This conclusion is potentially important for understanding the early evolution of the advanced eusocial insects, such as ants, termites, and corbiculate bees.},

	abstract = {"The halictid bee tribe Augochlorini is revised at the level of genus and subgenus. Forty-one genera and subgenera are recognized with two being extinct. New subgenera of Augochlora, Electraugochlora, and of Oligochlora, Soliapis, are described for new fossils from Tertiary amber of the Dominican Republic. Complete taxonomic histories are given along with information on revisions at the species level, biological studies, and general distribution for each family- and genus-group taxon. The following subgenera are newly synonymized: Aethechlora new junior subjective synonym of Oxystoglossella, Mycterochlora new junior subjective synonym of Augochlora, Vachalius new junior subjective synonym of Neocorynurella, and Neocorynuroides new junior subjective synonym of Neocorynura. The group Glyptochlora is resurrected from synonymy as a valid subgenus of Augochloropsis. The males of Chlerogella and Micrommation are described for the first time. A key to the genera and subgenera of the tribe is presented along with a key to the species of the rare Augochloropsis (Glyptochlora). Suprageneric relationships in the tribe are explored cladistically. Characters of adult external morphology (72 characters) and ethology (12 characters) are coded for all recognized augochlorine genera as well as outgroups from the Halictini, Nomioidini, and Nomiinae. Results of the cladistic analysis are remarkably resolved but not very robust. The cladogram is summarized and infratribal groups defined. Most notably, the tribe is divided into two monophyletic subtribes: the Corynurina (new subtribe), containing the southern South American genera Corynura, Halictillus, Rhectomia, and Rhinocorynura; and the nominate subtribe, Augochlorina. Implications of the cladistic analysis on diversification in the Augochlorini and evolutionary patterns within the tribe are discussed. New distribution records are given for three species which extend the known ranges of their respective genera. Augochlora essequibensis is a new junior subjective synonym of A. nigrocyanea while A. cladopyga, A. seminigra, Augochlorella bidentata, Halictus caucasicus, H. cerasis, H. chrysaspis, H. myrrhites, H. simotes, and Pereirapis rhizophila are all new junior subjective synonyms of P. semiaurata. Megalopta intermedia, Augochlora nitidior, Augochlorella eusticta, Augochlorodes clementis, and Augochloropsis scabriceps are all recognized as nomina nuda. Vachalius cosmetor, from Colombia and Venezuela, is transferred to Neocorynurella while Corynura biciliata, from Costa Rica, is recognized as a species of Halictini and is transferred to the genus Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) (new combinations). Four fossil and recent species new to science are described as Augochlora (Electraugochlora) leptoloba (fossil), Augochlora (Oxystoglossella) rightmyerae (extant), Oligochlora (Soliapis) rozeni (fossil), and Pseudaugoehlora pulchra (extant)"--P. 4.},

In southern Ontario, Canada, near the northern edge of the range, most nests are social, containing groups of two to five adult females. Although social nests were much more frequent than solitary ones, they produced no more brood, so per capita brood productivity was actually lower for social females. Social females exhibited several reproductive strategies inferred from wing wear patterns, which reflect flight activity, and mandibular wear patterns, which reflect nest construction activity. Primary females accumulated a large degree of wing and mandibular wear and were presumed to be the primary reproductives in social nests. Secondary females accumulated less wing and mandibular wear and were probably subordinates awaiting opportunities to supersede primaries as dominant foragers and egg-layers. Tertiary females remained inactive, apparently deferring reproduction to the subsequent year. Social nesting, serial replacement of dominant females in social nests, and deferred reproduction are probably responses to severe competition for nests and nesting substrate.},

Like many other Lasioglossum species, L. coeruleum constructs dependent cells in the sense of Malyshev. In spring the nests are built by overwintered females which emerged at the end of the previous summer and were fertilized prior to hibernation. The offspring raised by these females include males, and fertilized young females at the beginning of July. These females are capable of founding new nests but they also may remain in the nests of their mothers as replacement queens. Sterile workers were also found in summer nests.},

Understanding the relationship between species characteristics and network structure help us understand the assembly of natural communities and how communities function. Here, we examine how species traits may affect the rules leading to patterns of interaction among plants and fruit‐eating vertebrates. We study a species‐rich seed‐dispersal system using a model selection approach to examine whether the rules underlying network structure are driven by constraints in fruit resource exploitation, by preferential consumption of fruits by the frugivores, or by a combination of both. We performed analyses for the whole system and for bird and mammal assemblages separately, and identified the animal and plant characteristics shaping interaction rules. The structure of the analyzed interaction network was better explained by constraints in resource exploitation in the case of birds and by preferential consumption of fruits with specific traits for mammals. These contrasting results when looking at bird–plant and mammal–plant interactions suggest that the same type of interaction is organized by different processes depending on the assemblage we focus on. Size‐related restrictions of the interacting species (both for mammals and birds) were the most important factors driving the interaction rules. Our results suggest that the structure of seed‐dispersal interaction networks can be explained using species traits and interaction rules related to simple ecological mechanisms.},

How pollination services respond to such stressors depends on the capacity of pollinator assemblages to function in the face of environmental disruption. Here, we quantify how pollination services provided to a native plant change upon removal of the non-native, western honey bee (Apis mellifera)—a numerically dominant floral visitor in the native bee-rich ecosystems of southern California. We focus on services provided to clustered tarweed (Deinandra fasciculata), a native, annual forb that benefits from outcross pollination. Across five different study sites in coastal San Diego County, tarweed flowers attracted 70 insect taxa, approximately half of which were native bees, but non-native honey bees were always the most abundant floral visitor at each site. To test the ability of the native insect fauna to provide pollination services, we performed Apis removals within experimental 0.25 m2 plots containing approximately 20 tarweed plants and compared visitation and seed set between plants in removal and paired control plots (n = 16 pairs). Even though 92\% of observed floral visits to control plots were from honey bees, Apis removal reduced seed production by only 14\% relative to plants in control plots. These results indicate that native insect assemblages can contribute important pollination services even in ecosystems numerically dominated by introduced pollinators.},

	abstract = {*
The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models.



*
The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest.



*
One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation).



*
Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems.



*
This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

	abstract = {* The açaí palm Euterpe oleracea Mart. in the Amazon river delta has seen rapid expansion to meet increased demand for its fruit. This has been achieved by transforming lowland forest habitats (floodplains) into simplified agroforests and intensive plantation in upland areas. As açaí palm makes an important contribution to the economy and food security of local communities, identifying management approaches that support biodiversity and ecosystem processes that underpin fruit production on açaí farms is essential.


* We compared flower-visitor communities and açaí fruit production in floodplain forests and upland plantations, across gradients of local management intensity (i.e. açaí density per ha) and surrounding forest cover. The relative contribution of biotic pollination and degree of pollen limitation were assessed using insect exclusion and hand-pollination experiments.


* We found that açaí flower visitors are highly diverse (c. 200 distinct taxa) and had variable responses to disturbance. Bee visitation was higher in floodplains and positively related to surrounding forest cover, but other flower visitors, including specialised curculionid beetles, were unresponsive to changes in surrounding forest cover. However, intensive management practices (i.e. high açaí palm densities) in floodplains and uplands had contrasting effects on flower-visitor communities, with flower-visitor richness being lower on intensively managed floodplain farms and ant densities being higher on intensive upland farms.


* Pollination experiments revealed açaí palm to be highly dependent on biotic pollination. Fruit set in open-pollinated inflorescences was positively related to flower-visitor richness and specialised curculionid beetle visitation, whereas the presence of ants on inflorescences had a negative effect.


* Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that pollinators are essential for açaí fruit production, but that intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities). These findings underline the value of extensive management practices, such as the maintenance of other tree species within farms and adjacent unmanaged forest patches, to ensure the long-term sustainability of açaí fruit production in the Amazon river delta.},

Current approaches to conservation may be inadequate to maintain ecosystem integrity because they are mostly based on rarity status of organisms rather than functional significance. Alternatively, approaches focusing on the protection of ecological networks lead to more appropriate conservation targets to maintain ecosystem integrity.



*
We propose that a shift in focus from species to interaction networks is necessary to achieve pressing conservation management and restoration ecology goals of conserving biodiversity, ecosystem processes and ultimately landscape-scale delivery of ecosystem services.



*
Using topical examples from the literature, we discuss historical and conceptual advances, current challenges and ways to move forward. We also propose a road map to ecological network conservation, providing a novel ready to use approach to identify clear conservation targets with flexible data requirements.



*
Synthesis and applications. Integration of how environmental and spatial constraints affect the nature and strength of local interaction networks will improve our ability to predict their response to change and to conserve them. This will better protect species, ecosystem processes, and the resulting ecosystem services we depend on.},

A common problem is that the numerical nature of the ecological phenomenon does not always fit the assumptions underlying traditional statistical tests. A text book example comes from pollination ecology where flower visits are normally reported as frequencies; number of visits per flower per unit time. Using visitation frequencies in statistical analyses comes with two major caveats: the lack of knowledge on its error distribution and that it does not include all information found in the data; 10 flower visits in 20 flowers is treated the same as recording 100 visits in 200 flowers. We simulated datasets with various “flower visitation distributions” over various numbers of flowers observed (exposure) and with different types of effects inducing variation in the data. The different datasets were then analyzed first with the traditional approach using number of visits per flower and then by using count data models. The analysis of count data gave a much better chance of detecting effects than the traditionally used frequency approach. We conclude that if the data structure, statistical analyses and interpretations of results are mixed up, valuable information can be lost.},

There is evidence that pollinators are declining as a result of local and global environmental degradation [1–4]. Because a sizable proportion of the human diet depends directly or indirectly on animal pollination [5], the issue of how decreases in pollinator stocks could affect global crop production is of paramount importance [6–8]. Using the extensive FAO data set [9], we compared 45 year series (1961–2006) in yield, and total production and cultivated area of pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops [5]. We investigated temporal trends separately for the developed and developing world because differences in agricultural intensification, and socioeconomic and environmental conditions might affect yield and pollinators [10–13]. Since 1961, crop yield (Mt/ha) has increased consistently at average annual growth rates of ∼1.5\%. Temporal trends were similar between pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops in both the developed and developing world, thus not supporting the view that pollinator shortages are affecting crop yield at the global scale. We further report, however, that agriculture has become more pollinator dependent because of a disproportionate increase in the area cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops. If the trend toward favoring cultivation of pollinator-dependent crops continues, the need for the service provided by declining pollinators will greatly increase in the near future.},

Measuring the robustness of multilayer networks in the long term is one way of integrating ecological metrics more generally into biomonitoring schemes to better measure biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks are nevertheless difficult and labour-intensive to construct using conventional approaches, especially when building multilayer networks in poorly studied ecosystems (i.e. many tropical regions). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides unprecedented opportunities to rapidly build highly resolved species interaction networks across multiple trophic levels, but are yet to be fully exploited. We highlight the impediments to ecologists wishing to build DNA-based ecological networks and discuss some possible solutions. Machine learning and better data sharing between ecologists represent very important areas for advances in NGS-based networks. The future of network ecology is very exciting as all the tools necessary to build highly resolved multilayer networks are now within ecologists reach.},

Our knowledge creation agenda is based on six broad policy goals, with several associated knowledge gaps for each goal.

Summary

The Brazilian Atlantic Forest hosts one of the world's most diverse and threatened tropical forest biota. In many ways, its history of degradation describes the fate experienced by tropical forests around the world. After five centuries of human expansion, most Atlantic Forest landscapes are archipelagos of small forest fragments surrounded by open-habitat matrices. This ‘natural laboratory’ has contributed to a better understanding of the evolutionary history and ecology of tropical forests and to determining the extent to which this irreplaceable biota is susceptible to major human disturbances. We share some of the major findings with respect to the responses of tropical forests to human disturbances across multiple biological levels and spatial scales and discuss some of the conservation initiatives adopted in the past decade. First, we provide a short description of the Atlantic Forest biota and its historical degradation. Secondly, we offer conceptual models describing major shifts experienced by tree assemblages at local scales and discuss landscape ecological processes that can help to maintain this biota at larger scales. We also examine potential plant responses to climate change. Finally, we propose a research agenda to improve the conservation value of human-modified landscapes and safeguard the biological heritage of tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Ecological systems are vulnerable to irreversible change when key system properties are pushed over thresholds, resulting in the loss of resilience and the precipitation of a regime shift. Perhaps the most important of such properties in human-modified landscapes is the total amount of remnant native vegetation. In a seminal study Andrén proposed the existence of a fragmentation threshold in the total amount of remnant vegetation, below which landscape-scale connectivity is eroded and local species richness and abundance become dependent on patch size. Despite the fact that species patch-area effects have been a mainstay of conservation science there has yet to be a robust empirical evaluation of this hypothesis. Here we present and test a new conceptual model describing the mechanisms and consequences of biodiversity change in fragmented landscapes, identifying the fragmentation threshold as a first step in a positive feedback mechanism that has the capacity to impair ecological resilience, and drive a regime shift in biodiversity. The model considers that local extinction risk is defined by patch size, and immigration rates by landscape vegetation cover, and that the recovery from local species losses depends upon the landscape species pool. Using a unique dataset on the distribution of non-volant small mammals across replicate landscapes in the Atlantic forest of Brazil, we found strong evidence for our model predictions - that patch-area effects are evident only at intermediate levels of total forest cover, where landscape diversity is still high and opportunities for enhancing biodiversity through local management are greatest. Furthermore, high levels of forest loss can push native biota through an extinction filter, and result in the abrupt, landscape-wide loss of forest-specialist taxa, ecological resilience and management effectiveness. The proposed model links hitherto distinct theoretical approaches within a single framework, providing a powerful tool for analysing the potential effectiveness of management interventions.},

However, there exists no broad-scale information about the spatial distribution of its remnants that could guide conservation actions, especially when systematic biodiversity data are not available. In this context, our objectives were to quantify how much of the forest still remains, and analyze its spatial distribution. We considered the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and eight sub-regions, defined according to species distribution. The results revealed a serious situation: more than 80\% of the fragments are {\textless}50ha, almost half the remaining forest is {\textless}100m from its edges, the average distance between fragments is large (1440m), and nature reserves protect only 9\% of the remaining forest and 1\% of the original forest. On the other hand, our estimates of existing Atlantic Forest cover were higher than previous ones (7–8\%), ranging from 11.4\% to 16\%. The differences among estimates are mainly related to our inclusion of intermediate secondary forests and small fragments ({\textless}100ha), which correspond to approximately 32–40\% of what remains. We suggest some guidelines for conservation: (i) large mature forest fragments should be a conservation priority; (ii) smaller fragments can be managed in order to maintain functionally linked mosaics; (iii) the matrix surrounding fragments should be managed so as to minimize edge effects and improve connectivity; and (iv) restoration actions should be taken, particularly in certain key areas. The clear differences in the amount remaining and its spatial distribution within each sub-region must be considered when planning for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of ecological restoration actions toward biodiversity conservation depends on both local and landscape constraints. Extensive information on local constraints is already available, but few studies consider the landscape context when planning restoration actions. We propose a multiscale framework based on the landscape attributes of habitat amount and connectivity to infer landscape resilience and to set priority areas for restoration. Landscapes with intermediate habitat amount and where connectivity remains sufficiently high to favor recolonization were considered to be intermediately resilient, with high possibilities of restoration effectiveness and thus were designated as priority areas for restoration actions. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) quantifying habitat amount and connectivity; (2) using landscape ecology theory to identify intermediate resilience landscapes based on habitat amount, percolation theory, and landscape connectivity; and (3) ranking landscapes according to their importance as corridors or bottlenecks for biological flows on a broader scale, based on a graph theory approach. We present a case study for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (approximately 150 million hectares) in order to demonstrate the proposed method. For the Atlantic Forest, landscapes that present high restoration effectiveness represent only 10\% of the region, but contain approximately 15 million hectares that could be targeted for restoration actions (an area similar to today's remaining forest extent). The proposed method represents a practical way to both plan restoration actions and optimize biodiversity conservation efforts by focusing on landscapes that would result in greater conservation benefits.},

Here, we review the empirical literature to synthesize the research effort that has been directed to investigate specific practices or goals to make general statements regarding the causes and consequences of farmland biodiversity decline. We argue that the loss of ecological heterogeneity at multiple spatial and temporal scales is a universal consequence of multivariate agricultural intensification and, therefore, that future research should develop cross-cutting policy frameworks and management solutions that recreate that heterogeneity as the key to restoring and sustaining biodiversity in temperate agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services introduced a new view on the relationship between biodiversity and human well being. But are both concepts, biodiversity and ecosystem services, mutually beneficial? We will try to unravel part of this much debated question in three steps. Firstly, a general hypothesis describing the present link between biodiversity, ecosystem services and land use intensity is tested for the region of Flanders (13.682km2). The spatial exercise illustrates that even in a densely populated area as Flanders (539inhabitants/km2), scores for biodiversity and ecosystem services show a clear decline with an increase in land use intensity. Despite the overall congruence of the rough indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services used in this exercise, the need for new indicators integrating key structural and functional aspects of the ecosystem is highlighted. In a second step a target scheme is proposed describing the relation between biodiversity and land use intensity, for the long-term future. In this conceptual framework the need for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity hot spots is emphasized. At the same time the importance of the search for an environmental ‘bottom line’ is stressed. What is the minimum amount of biodiversity needed to reach sustainable use? And what is the critical point for human impact beyond which society will largely depend on the import of ecosystem services to sustain or increase its well-being? In a third step, ecosystem management is used as a concept to bridge the gap between the present and the target scheme. Ecosystem management is divided into three focal zones. (1) For the remaining zones with a high biodiversity and a low intensity of land use, a biodiversity conservation based approach is needed. (2) For most rural areas with multifunctional uses and a good state as a future perspective, a focus on ecosystem services is a good point of departure. (3) In the built-up areas and intensively used agricultural sites, beyond the minimum standards for land use intensity, a technological service based approach will be necessary. A division of ecosystem management into these three zones confirms the complementarity of biodiversity and ecosystem services for policy and management strategies. The concept of this triple division can help to facilitate the discussion of a joint achievement of the goals for biodiversity and ecosystem services in the field.},

	abstract = {Organic agriculture refers to a farming system that enhance soil fertility through maximizing the efficient use of local resources, while foregoing the use of agrochemicals, the use of Genetic Modified Organisms (GMO), as well as that of many synthetic compounds used as food additives. Organic agriculture relies on a number of farming practices based on ecological cycles, and aims at minimizing the environmental impact of the food industry, preserving the long term sustainability of soil and reducing to a minimum the use of non renewable resources. This paper carries out a comparative review of the environmental performances of organic agriculture versus conventional farming, and also discusses the difficulties inherent in this comparison process. The paper first provides an historical background on organic agriculture and briefly reports on some key socioeconomic issues concerning organic farming. It then focuses on how agricultural practices affect soil characteristics: under organic management soil loss is greatly reduced and soil organic matter (SOM) content increases. Soil biochemical and ecological characteristics appear also improved. Furthermore, organically managed soils have a much higher water holding capacity than conventionally managed soils, resulting in much larger yields compared to conventional farming, under conditions of water scarcity. Because of its higher ability to store carbon in the soil, organic agriculture could represent a means to improve CO2 abatement if adopted on a large scale. Next, the impact on biodiversity is highlighted: organic farming systems generally harbor a larger floral and faunal biodiversity than conventional systems, although when properly managed also the latter can improve biodiversity. Importantly, the landscape surrounding farmed land also appears to have the potential to enhance biodiversity in agricultural areas. The paper then outlines energy use in different agricultural settings: organic agriculture has higher energy efficiency (input/output) but, on average, exhibits lower yields and hence reduced productivity. Nevertheless, overall, organic agriculture appears to perform better than conventional farming, and provides also other important environmental advantages, such as halting the use of harmful chemicals and their spread in the environment and along the trophic chain, and reducing water use. Looking at the future of organic farming, based on the findings presented in this review, there is clearly a need for more research and investment directed to exploring potential of organic farming for reducing the environmental impact of agricultural practices; however, the implications of reduced productivity for the socioeconomic system should also be considered and suitable agricultural policies should be developed.},

Studies performed at a very large spatial scale are helpful in understanding the reasons for this decline and as a basis for guiding policy. In a unique, large-scale study of 25 agricultural landscapes in seven European countries, we investigated relationships between species richness in several taxa, and the links between biodiversity and landscape structure and management.
* 2We estimated the total species richness of vascular plants, birds and five arthropod groups in each 16-km2 landscape, and recorded various measures of both landscape structure and intensity of agricultural land use. We studied correlations between taxonomic groups and the effects of landscape and land-use parameters on the number of species in different taxonomic groups. Our statistical approach also accounted for regional variation in species richness unrelated to landscape or land-use factors.
* 3The results reveal strong geographical trends in species richness in all taxonomic groups. No single species group emerged as a good predictor of all other species groups. Species richness of all groups increased with the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Species richness of birds and vascular plants was negatively associated with fertilizer use.
* 4Synthesis and applications. We conclude that indicator taxa are unlikely to provide an effective means of predicting biodiversity at a large spatial scale, especially where there is large biogeographical variation in species richness. However, a small list of landscape and land-use parameters can be used in agricultural landscapes to infer large-scale patterns of species richness. Our results suggest that to halt the loss of biodiversity in these landscapes, it is important to preserve and, if possible, increase the area of semi-natural habitat.},

Importantly, the loss of certain species can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions, resulting in further degradation of a system with potential effects on ecosystem functioning. It is thus crucial to better our understanding of the types of species which, if lost, will affect community structure the most, because in this context they are analogous to keystone species. Here, using a dynamical approach and simulating species loss in model communities, we study whether the importance of species changes as the structure of the food web changes by analyzing the potential importance of 11 species traits during food web collapse following simulated extinctions. We find that the keystone status of species traits is context dependent, with the identity of the most important trait changing during food web collapse. The relative importance of two trait categories tend to be inversely related, with body size based traits being important in intact to moderately degraded webs and interaction strength based species traits being important in highly collapsed food webs. The results of our study furthermore suggest that the response of communities to small and large perturbations may be related in the sense that the same kinds of species are important in both situations.},

If pollination fails, ecosystems are eroded and we will lose reliable sources of many critical foodstuffs. Focusing on the pollination services provided by bees, Goulson et al. review the stresses bees are experiencing from climate change, infectious diseases, and insecticides. We can mitigate some of the stress on bees by improving floral resources and adopting quarantine measures, and by surveillance of bee populations. Crucially, we need to resolve the controversy surrounding prophylactic use of pesticides.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255957
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUND The species richness of wild bees and other pollinators has declined over the past 50 years, with some species undergoing major declines and a few going extinct. Evidence of the causes of these losses is patchy and incomplete, owing to inadequate monitoring systems. Managed honey bee stocks have also declined in North America and many European countries, although they have increased substantially in China. During this same period, the demand for insect pollination of crops has approximately tripled, and the importance of wild pollinators in providing such services has become increasingly apparent, leading to concern that we may be nearing a “pollination crisis” in which crop yields begin to fall. This has stimulated much-needed research into the causes of bee declines. Habitat loss, which has reduced the abundance and diversity of floral resources and nesting opportunities, has undoubtedly been a major long-term driver through the 20th century and still continues today. In addition, both wild and managed bees have been exposed to a succession of emerging parasites and pathogens that have been accidentally moved around the world by human action. The intensification of agriculture and increasing reliance on pesticides means that pollinators are also chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals. Predicted changes in global climate are likely to further exacerbate such problems in the future.
ADVANCES It has lately become clear that stressors do not act in isolation and that their interactions may be difficult to predict; for example, some pesticides act synergistically rather than additively. Both pesticide exposure and food stress can impair immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but the precise combination apparently differs from place to place. Although the causes of pollinator decline may be complex and subject to disagreement, solutions need not be; taking steps to reduce or remove any of these stresses is likely to benefit pollinator health. Several techniques are available that have been demonstrated to effectively increase floral availability in farmland. Similarly, encouraging gardeners to grow appropriate bee-friendly flowers and to improve management of amenity grasslands can also reduce dietary stress. Retaining or restoring areas of seminatural habitat within farmland will improve nest site availability. A return to the principles of integrated pest management and avoidance of prophylactic use of agrochemicals could greatly decrease exposure of bees to pesticides.
OUTLOOK Interactions among agrochemicals and stressors are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, which typically expose well-fed, parasite-free bees to a single pesticide for a short period of time. Devising approaches to study these interactions and incorporating them into the regulatory process poses a major challenge. In the meantime, providing support and advice for farmers in more sustainable farming methods with reduced pesticide use is likely to have broad benefits for farmland biodiversity. Enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements to prevent further spread of bee parasites is also vital. Finally, effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies. Without this, we have no early warning system to tell us how close we may be to a pollination crisis. With a growing human population and rapid growth in global demand for pollination services, we cannot afford to see crop yields begin to fall, and we would be well advised to take preemptive action to ensure that we have adequate pollination services into the future. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6229/1255957/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Multiple interacting stressors drive bee declines. Both wild and managed bees are subject to a number of important and interacting stressors. For example, exposure to some fungicides can greatly increase the toxicity of insecticides, whereas exposure to insecticides reduces resistance to diseases.

Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread concern about declines in pollination services, little is known about the patterns of change in most pollinator assemblages. By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre-versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species.
In two European countries, losses of particular bee species are associated with declines in the plants they pollinate.

We find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process.

	abstract = {The evolution of altruism—costly self-sacrifice in the service of others—has puzzled biologists1 since The Origin of Species. For half a century, attempts to understand altruism have developed around the concept that altruists may help relatives to have extra offspring in order to spread shared genes2. This theory—known as inclusive fitness—is founded on a simple inequality termed Hamilton’s rule2. However, explanations of altruism have typically not considered the stochasticity of natural environments, which will not necessarily favour genotypes that produce the greatest average reproductive success3,4. Moreover, empirical data across many taxa reveal associations between altruism and environmental stochasticity5,6,7,8, a pattern not predicted by standard interpretations of Hamilton’s rule. Here we derive Hamilton’s rule with explicit stochasticity, leading to new predictions about the evolution of altruism. We show that altruists can increase the long-term success of their genotype by reducing the temporal variability in the number of offspring produced by their relatives. Consequently, costly altruism can evolve even if it has a net negative effect on the average reproductive success of related recipients. The selective pressure on volatility-suppressing altruism is proportional to the coefficient of variation in population fitness, and is therefore diminished by its own success. Our results formalize the hitherto elusive link between bet-hedging and altruism4,9,10,11, and reveal missing fitness effects in the evolution of animal societies.},

Interactions involving large-sized species were lost in fragments {\textless} 10 000 ha, indicating a strong filtering by habitat fragmentation on the functional diversity of BSD-interactions. Persistent interactions were performed by small-seeded, fast growing plant species and by generalist, small-bodied bird species able to cross the fragmented landscape.

Most studies report a positive relationship between species richness and the number of ecosystem functions. However, it is not known whether the number of functional groups is related to the structure of the underlying species interaction network. Here we present food web data from 115 salt marsh islands and show that network structure is associated with the number of functional groups present. Functional group diversity is heterogeneously distributed across spatial scales, with some islands hosting more functional groups than others. Functional groups form modules within the community so that food webs with more modular architectures have more functional group diversity. Further, in communities with different interaction types, modularity can be seen as the multifunctional equivalent of trophic complementarity. Collectively, these findings reveal spatial heterogeneity in the number of functional groups that emerges from patterns in the structure of the food web.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and the intensification of farming practices have caused severe declines in the range and abundance of many bumblebee species in the UK. This study examines the long-term effectiveness of four different management strategies to enhance and restore bumblebee foraging habitat on arable field margins in two regions with markedly contrasting landscape structure, farming systems and amount of semi-natural habitat. Bumblebees were monitored on 120 field margins in July and August, together with estimates of flower abundance and the vegetation composition. There were no differences in the abundance and diversity of the bumblebee assemblage between the two regions (East Anglia and the West Midlands), despite a greater abundance of flowers and flowering species on the lighter soils of the West Midlands. Very few bumblebees were recorded on intensively managed cereal field margins due to the lack of dicot species. Conservation headlands supported a significantly greater number of flowering dicots, but the majority of these were annuals which did not provide good forage for bumblebees. From an agronomic and ecological perspective, the removal of field margins from the cropping system was the best strategy for providing foraging habitat for bumblebees. Non-crop habitat resulting from natural regeneration provided good foraging habitat for bumblebee species, but most of the key forage species were pernicious weeds of agriculture (Cirsium spp.). Sowing non-crop field margins with wildlife seed mixtures had the potential for providing the best foraging habitat for bumblebees, so long as preferred forage species were introduced (e.g. Trifolium pratense). Further research is required to refine and target this management prescription for bumblebee conservation in the wider countryside.},

There are few long?term data on bee populations, which makes their conservation status difficult to assess. The best?studied groups are the genus Bombus (the bumble bees), and bees in the EU generally; both of these are clearly declining. However, it is not known to what extent these groups represent the approximately 20,000 species of bees globally. As is the case for insects in general, bees are underrepresented in conservation planning and protection efforts. For example, only two bee species are on the global IUCN Red List, and no bee is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, even though many bee species are known to be in steep decline or possibly extinct. At present, bee restoration occurs mainly in agricultural contexts, funded by government programs such as agri?environment schemes (EU) and the Farm Bill (USA). This is a promising approach given that many bee species can use human?disturbed habitats, and bees provide valuable pollination services to crops. However, agricultural restorations only benefit species that persist in agricultural landscapes, and they are more expensive than preserving natural habitat elsewhere. Furthermore, such restorations benefit bees in only about half of studied cases. More research is greatly needed in many areas of bee conservation, including basic population biology, bee restoration in nonagricultural contexts, and the identification of disturbance?sensitive bee species.},

Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here, we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reflects random fluctuations around a pollen?resource equilibrium, an adaptation to stochastic pollination environments, or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westoby's conceptual model, and illustrate its use in guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation, i.e., whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life?history characters, Allee effects, and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly, our synthesis identifies a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels.},

	abstract = {Bees are essential pollinators of many plants in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops alike. In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees.},

	abstract = {Summary
The prospect that a global pollination crisis currently threatens agricultural productivity has drawn intense recent interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public [1–5]. To date, evidence for a global crisis has been drawn from regional or local declines in pollinators themselves [6–9] or insufficient pollination for particular crops [9, 10]. In contrast, our analysis of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [11] data reveals that the global population of managed honey-bee hives has increased ∼45\% during the last half century and suggests that economic globalization, rather than biological factors, drives both the dynamics of the global managed honey-bee population and increasing demands for agricultural pollination services [12]. Nevertheless, available data also reveal a much more rapid ({\textgreater}300\%) increase in the fraction of agriculture that depends on animal pollination during the last half century, which may be stressing global pollination capacity. Although the primary cause of the accelerating increase of the pollinator dependence of commercial agriculture seems to be economic and political and not biological, the rapid expansion of cultivation of many pollinator-dependent crops has the potential to trigger future pollination problems for both these crops and native species in neighboring areas. Such environmental costs merit consideration during the development of agriculture and conservation policies.},

	abstract = {The worldwide decline of pollinators may negatively affect the fruit set of wild and cultivated plants. Here, we show that fruit set of the self–fertilizing highland coffee (Coffea arabica) is highly variable and related to bee pollination. In a comparison of 24 agroforestry systems in Indonesia, the fruit set of coffee could be predicted by the number of flower–visiting bee species, and it ranged from ca. 60\% (three species) to 90\% (20 species). Diversity, not abundance, explained variation in fruit set, so the collective role of a species–rich bee community was important for pollination success. Additional experiments showed that single flower visits from rare solitary species led to higher fruit set than with abundant social species. Pollinator diversity was affected by two habitat parameters indicating guild–specific nesting requirements: the diversity of social bees decreased with forest distance, whereas the diversity of solitary bees increased with light intensity of the agroforestry systems. These results give empirical evidence for a positive relationship between ecosystem functions such as pollination and biodiversity. Conservation of rainforest adjacent to adequately managed agroforestry systems could improve the yields of farmers.},

In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60\% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35\% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5\% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.},

	abstract = {Background
The rich literature that characterizes the field of pollination biology has focused largely on animal-pollinated plants. At least 10 \% of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.

Scope and Conclusions
Wind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that diverse predator assemblages can be more effective at controlling prey populations. Yet, other studies have shown no effect of predator diversity on prey mortality, or even negative effects (for example due to intraguild predation or interference). Much research emphasis has been placed on the traits of predators that maximise functional complementarity. However, comparatively less attention has been paid to the traits of the prey or habitat that may maximise predator diversity effects, even though there must be a variety of prey niches available to be partitioned in order for niche complementarity to occur. Following this logic, we review six hypotheses for when diverse enemy assemblages should be most effective: when 1) prey communities are diverse; 2) prey have complex life cycles; 3) prey are patchily distributed in space or time; 4) studies are conducted at larger spatial and temporal scales; 5) plant structures are complex; 6) prey are abundant. Many of these hypotheses lack direct tests, particularly in agricultural systems, but we find little or no direct or indirect support for hypotheses 1, 4, 5 and 6. However, previous work does provide some support for hypotheses 2 and 3. We discuss methods to test these hypotheses directly, and suggest that natural enemy diversity may only benefit the biological control of arthropods in heterogeneous systems.
Zusammenfassung
Zahlreiche Studien haben gezeigt, dass diverse Räubergemeinschaften Beutepopulationen effektiver kontrollieren können. Andere Studien haben dagegen keinen Effekt der Räuberdiversität auf die Beutemortalität nachweisen können oder sogar negative Effekte gefunden (z.B. durch Prädation innerhalb der Prädatorengilde oder Interferenz). Besonderes Augenmerk hat die Forschung auf die Merkmale von Räubern gelegt, die die funktionale Komplementarität maximieren. Vergleichsweise geringe Aufmerksamkeit wurde indessen den Merkmalen der Beute und des Lebensraumes geschenkt, welche die Auswirkungen der Räuberdiversität maximieren, auch wenn eine Auswahl von zu verteilenden Beutenischen vorhanden sein muss, damit Nischen-Komplementarität auftreten kann. Dieser Logik folgend besprechen wir sechs Hypothesen dazu, wann diverse Räubergemeinschaften am effektivsten sein sollten, nämlich 1) wenn die Beutegemeinschaften divers sind, 2) wenn die Beuteorganismen komplexe Lebenszyklen aufweisen, 3) wenn die Beute ungleichmäßig in Raum und Zeit verteilt ist, 4) wenn die Untersuchungen auf größeren räumlichen oder zeitlichen Skalen durchgeführt werden, 5) wenn die Pflanzen strukturell komplex sind, 6) wenn die Siedlungsdichte der Beutetiere hoch ist. Für viele dieser Hypothesen gibt es keine direkten Tests, insbesondere keine aus Agrarökosystemen, aber wir finden wenig oder keine direkte oder indirekte Unterstützung für die Hypothesen 1, 4, 5 und 6. Dagegen gibt es aus vorhandenen Arbeiten einen gewissen Rückhalt für die Hypothesen 2 und 3. Wir diskutieren Methoden, diese Hypothesen direkt zu testen, und formulieren die These, dass die Diversität natürlicher Gegenspieler die biologische Kontrolle von Arthropoden nur in einer heterogenen Umgebung begünstigen sollte.},

Identifying communities of nodes that tend to interact more with each other than the network as a whole is a key research focus across multiple disciplines, yet many community detection algorithms only use information about the presence or absence of interactions between nodes. Weighted modularity is a potential method for evaluating the quality of community partitions in quantitative networks. In this framework, the optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the partition that maximizes modularity. Attempting to find the partition that maximizes modularity is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms. QuanBiMo is an algorithm that has been proposed to maximize weighted modularity in bipartite networks. This paper introduces two new algorithms, LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+, for maximizing weighted modularity in bipartite networks. LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+ robustly identify partitions with high modularity scores. DIRTLPAwb+ consistently matched or outperformed QuanBiMo, while the speed of LPAwb+ makes it an attractive choice for detecting the modularity of larger networks. Searching for modules using weighted data (rather than binary data) provides a different and potentially insightful method for evaluating network partitions.},

The extinction of species that feed on or are fed on by many others (i.e. ?hubs?) has traditionally been thought to cause the greatest threat of further biodiversity loss. Very little attention has been paid to the strength of those feeding links (i.e. link weight) and the prevalence of indirect interactions. Here, we used a dynamical model based on empirical energy budget data to assess changes in ecosystem stability after simulating the loss of species according to various extinction scenarios. Link weight and/or indirect effects had stronger effects on food?web stability than the simple removal of ?hubs?, demonstrating that both quantitative fluxes and species dissipating their effects across many links should be of great concern in biodiversity conservation, and the potential for ?hubs? to act as keystone species may have been exaggerated to date.},

How affordable is biodiversity conservation in a fragmented landscape? Banks-Leite et al. asked this question for the biodiversity hotspot of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. An annual investment of {\textless}10\% of Brazil's agricultural subsidies could support effective ecological restoration on private lands. This would increase biodiversity in set-aside land to the same level observed in protected areas. The cost-effectiveness of this scheme suggests a path forward for conservation strategies in other similarly mixed landscapes, too.
Science, this issue p. 1041
Ecological set-asides are a promising strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes; however, landowner participation is often precluded by financial constraints. We assessed the ecological benefits and economic costs of paying landowners to set aside private land for restoration. Benefits were calculated from data on nearly 25,000 captures of Brazilian Atlantic Forest vertebrates, and economic costs were estimated for several restoration scenarios and values of payment for ecosystem services. We show that an annual investment equivalent to 6.5\% of what Brazil spends on agricultural subsidies would revert species composition and ecological functions across farmlands to levels found inside protected areas, thereby benefiting local people. Hence, efforts to secure the future of this and other biodiversity hotspots may be cost-effective.
A small portion of Brazil’s agricultural subsidies would be enough to preserve private land in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

	abstract = {Abstract Conservation translocations, anthropogenic movements of species to prevent their extinction, have increased substantially over the last few decades. Although multiple species are frequently moved to the same location, current translocation guidelines consider species in isolation. This practice ignores important interspecific interactions and thereby risks translocation failure. We model three different two?species systems to illustrate the inherent complexity of multispecies translocations and to assess the influence of different interaction types (consumer?resource, mutualism, and competition) on translocation strategies. We focus on how these different interaction types influence the optimal founder population sizes for successful translocations and the order in which the species are moved (simultaneous or sequential). Further, we assess the effect of interaction strength in simultaneous translocations and the time delay between translocations when moving two species sequentially. Our results show that translocation decisions need to reflect the type of interaction. While all translocations of interacting species require a minimum founder population size, which is demarked by an extinction boundary, consumer?resource translocations also have a maximum founder population limit. Above the minimum founder size, increasing the number of translocated individuals leads to a substantial increase in the extinction boundary of competitors and consumers, but not of mutualists. Competitive and consumer?resource systems benefit from sequential translocations, but the order of translocations does not change the outcomes for mutualistic interaction partners noticeably. Interspecific interactions are important processes that shape population dynamics and should therefore be incorporated into the quantitative planning of multispecies translocations. Our findings apply whenever interacting species are moved, for example, in reintroductions, conservation introductions, biological control, or ecosystem restoration.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have examined separately how pollinator generalization and abundance influence plant reproductive success, but none so far has evaluated simultaneously the relative importance of these pollinator attributes. Here we evaluated the extent to which pollinator generalization and abundance influence plant reproductive success per visit and at the population level on a generalist plant, Opuntia sulphurea (Cactaceae). We used field experiments and path analysis to evaluate whether the per-visit effect is determined by the pollinator’s degree of generalization, and whether the population level effect (pollinator impact) is determined by the pollinator’s degree of generalization and abundance. Based on the models we tested, we concluded that the per-visit effect of a pollinator on plant reproduction was not determined by the pollinators’ degree of generalization, while the population-level impact of a pollinator on plant reproduction was mainly determined by the pollinators’ degree of generalization. Thus, generalist pollinators have the greatest species impact on pollination and reproductive success of O. sulphurea. According to our analysis this greatest impact of generalist pollinators may be partly explained by pollinator abundance. However, as abundance does not suffice as an explanation of pollinator impact, we suggest that vagility, need for resource consumption, and energetic efficiency of generalist pollinators may also contribute to determine a pollinator’s impact on plant reproduction.},

In this review we highlight recent advances in this field focusing on both plant-driven and parasitoid-driven outcomes that flow up and down the trophic web, respectively. From the bottom-up, plant metabolites can impact parasitoid success by altering host immune function; however, few have considered the potential effects of other plant defense strategies such as tolerance on parasitoid ecology and behavior. From the top-down, parasitoids have long been considered plant bodyguards, but in reality the consequences of parasitism for herbivory rates and induction of plant defensive chemistry are far more complicated with cascading effects on community-level interactions.},

	abstract = {Plant?pollinator mutualistic networks represent the ecological context of foraging (for pollinators) and reproduction (for plants and some pollinators). Plant?pollinator visitation networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats and species assemblages. The most successful hypotheses to explain these network properties are the neutrality and biological constraints hypotheses, which posit that species interaction frequencies can be explained by species relative abundances, and trait mismatches between potential mutualists respectively. However, previous network analyses emphasize the prediction of metrics of qualitative network structure, which may not represent stringent tests of these hypotheses. Using a newly documented temporally explicit alpine plant?pollinator visitation network, we show that metrics of both qualitative and quantitative network structure are easy to predict, even by models that predict the identity or frequency of species interactions poorly. A variety of phenological and morphological constraints as well as neutral interactions successfully predicted all network metrics tested, without accurately predicting species observed interactions. Species phenology alone was the best predictor of observed interaction frequencies. However, all models were poor predictors of species pairwise interaction frequencies, suggesting that other aspects of species biology not generally considered in network studies, such as reproduction for dipterans, play an important role in shaping plant?pollinator visitation network structure at this site. Future progress in explaining the structure and dynamics of mutualistic networks will require new approaches that emphasize accurate prediction of species pairwise interactions rather than network metrics, and better reflect the biology underlying species interactions.},

At the same time, the species position within food webs or mutualistic networks (e.g. generalist or specialist, network hub or peripheral vertex) may affect their ability to persist after perturbations. This study was conducted in a heavily managed boreal forest landscape in southeastern Norway, using study plots situated in forest stands with contrasting disturbance history: old growth forest (least disturbed), young forest (intermediate) and clear cuts (most disturbed). By studying 12 pollination networks with contrasting disturbance history we found that important network descriptors were conserved after perturbation. Link?diversity was higher, both overall and per site, in the more disturbed communities while link?turnover was highest in the least disturbed community. We conclude that despite an increase in diversity in the more degraded habitat, the higher link?turnover in the least degraded, old growth forest, community indicates a homogenization of the plant?pollinator networks as a result of habitat degradation. Finally, we found that the degree (number of interacting partners) and network functional role for particular species changed along the disturbance gradient, though not in any systematic way. We conclude that structural properties of the pollination network are conserved after perturbations, but that particular species? network functional roles may change.},

Sod inoculation increased resemblance of the microbial community to the reference system, with a higher fungal and lower bacterial proportion to the community structure. Also densities of bacteriophagous and phytophagous nematodes, Acari and Collembola increased after sod inoculation. The cover of heathland plant species increased by 49\% after sod inoculation. The introduction of solely aboveground heathland species increased the cover of these species by only 13\%, and did not affect soil community assembly. Additionally, the increase in cover of heathland species over time was inversely correlated to the cover of mesotrophic grassland species. Inverse correlations were also observed between changes in fungal and bacterial abundances. Simultaneous introduction of key species of both above- and below-ground communities had a critical effect on the establishment of both communities, providing a potential shortcut for successful restoration of target ecosystems on disturbed soils.},

From networks of carbon exchanges, the keystone species are identified which include high trophic level carnivorous fish species like Argyrosomus japonicus, Caranx sexfasciatus and Monodactylus falciformis. It is observed that keystone species differed between seasons, according to changing conditions of the estuary. The positive and negative direct and indirect effects that the keystone species have on the different components of the system are evaluated by a Mixed Trophic Impacts (MTI) analysis and results of the direct-indirect impacts analysis are not consistent across seasons.Results reinforce the fact that the keystone species are context dependent as they show variation over the different networks following species composition change following alteration of the estuaries physical status and season. To simulate disturbance, the keystone species biomass in the initial five networks was changed by 10\% in stepwise intervals up to ± 99\% and it was observed that the system is somewhat resistant to the perturbation effects of the keystone species.},

	abstract = {Abstract Co?occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to infer networks of species interactions where detailed knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain. Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to, microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially intensive co?occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in central Chile to a well?resolved, empirically based, species interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the overlap in the information provided by each network and the extent to which there is a bias for co?occurrence data to better detect known trophic or non?trophic, positive or negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between the co?occurrence network and the known species interactions with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection) equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non?interaction) equal to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with interaction type. Positive non?trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest rates. These results demonstrate that co?occurrence networks do not represent classical ecological networks in which interactions are defined by direct observations or experimental manipulations. Co?occurrence networks provide information about the joint spatial effects of environmental conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect niche?expanding positive non?trophic interactions. Detection of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for well?known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in co?occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution, especially when extending interaction?based ecological theory to interpret network variability and stability. Co?occurrence networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of community dynamics that blends interactions and environment, rather than pairwise interactions alone.},

	abstract = {Apex predator reintroductions are commonly motivated by the imperative to restore populations and wider ecosystem function by precipitating trophic cascades that release basal species. Yet evidence for the existence of such cascades is often equivocal, particularly where consumptive interactions between apex and intermediate predators are weak or absent. Here, using a tri-trophic skate-crab-bivalve study-system, we find that non-consumptive interactions between apex skate and intermediate crabs cascade down to consumptive interactions between crabs and bivalves, significantly reducing bivalve mortality. However, skate only functioned as keystone where crabs foraged for bivalves in the absence of mature bivalve reef: where reef was present, bivalve mortality was not significantly different in the presence or absence of skate. By facilitating the establishment of basal species which, in turn, diminish apex-intermediate effects, the skate's keystone function is subject to negative regulation. Thus, we propose that keystone functionality can be transient with respect to environmental context. Our findings have two central implications for apex predator reintroductions and basic ecology: (i) species hitherto not considered as keystone may have the capacity to act as such transiently, and; (ii) keystones are known to regulate ecosystems, but transience implies that ecosystems can regulate keystone function.},

Two KSC indices are suggested and have been calculated in the coastal benthic/pelagic ecosystem of Fildes Bay, King George Island (Antarctica). These indices of keystoneness emerge after considering: (1) functional indices based on steady-state and dynamic quantitative trophic models (using bottom-up, mixed and top-down control flow mechanisms); (2) structural indices including bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms, (3) semi-quantitative (qualitative) keystone indices using loop analysis (under mixed control); and (4) topological key player indices based on the centrality of node sets in the network. The models constructed and analyzed describe the interactions of the most abundant species and functional groups inhabiting the coastal ecological systems of Fildes Bay. Although our results only represent the transient dynamics of these ecological systems, the KSC indices identified the following trophically connected common core of components: the functional groups of Seastars (top-predators), the herbivorous sea urchin species Sterechinus neumayeri and the Phytoplankton (primary producers). The KSC indices for Fildes Bay could facilitate the design and assessment of conservation monitoring, especially when the Antarctic ecosystems are being severely stressed by the direct effects of global warming and UV radiation. A more holistic view of conservation remains difficult because the traditional view is based principally on single species. This imposes an even greater challenge, for global changes accompany the network of interacting species, co-varying with the variables of the natural system.},

	abstract = {Summary Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of biodiversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predict community dynamics and stability. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes by determining species interactions through a two?step process. First, ecological and life?history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co?occurrence and the potential for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits between co?occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on predicting interactions from species co?occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring trait matching. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait?matching constraints, while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator?prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore?plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant?pollinator systems). Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.

	abstract = {As native ecosystems are degraded throughout the world, the importance of managing, conserving, and restoring wildlife habitat escalates. We must carefully consider which approach to habitat conservation is optimal, given that resources for habitat conservation are limited. One enticing option involves channeling limited resources to manage for a single umbrella species, assuming that a number of other species within the same ecosystem would also benefit. The danger inherent to this approach is that care must be taken when selecting an umbrella species that maximizes ecosystem-wide benefits. This paper presents a combination of methods to quantitatively evaluate if keystone species, given their integral role in affecting the ecosystem where they reside, can also function as effective umbrellas for habitat management. In a case study, we evaluate two imperiled keystone species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) and the red-cockaded woodpecker (Leucontopicus borealis), within a global biodiversity hotspot, the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of North American coastal plain. We 1) develop spatial habitat models in MaxEnt for 10 terrestrial vertebrate wildlife species of conservation interest across an 11 million hectare region, 2) identify the preferred umbrella candidate with spatially-explicit correlation and range overlap analyses using ENMTools, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen umbrella species with a test of niche similarity and quantitative habitat suitability comparisons in ArcGIS. Our results suggest the potential for an endemic keystone species to effectively function as an umbrella species. Specifically, we identified the gopher tortoise as the preferred umbrella, given the overlap in suitable habitat for 9 of 10 species evaluated in this ecosystem. These results are significant for habitat management within this region, but most importantly, this application of spatially-explicit modeling to quantitatively measure habitat suitability is an advance in approaches to habitat conservation planning. We encourage others to use these accessible methods and consider evaluating keystone species as umbrellas to optimize their approach for managing, conserving, and restoring ecosystems.},

However, this previous work has focused on either antagonistic (i.e., predator-prey) or mutualistic networks and has used different methodologies. Thus, a comparative assessment of both the frequency and the strength of phylogenetic signal across network types and components of network structure has been precluded. Here, we address this issue using a data set comprising 60 antagonistic and mutualistic networks. By quantifying simultaneously the matching and centrality components of network architecture—capturing the modular and nested structure, respectively—we test the presence and quantify the strength of phylogenetic signal across network types, species sets, and components of network structure. We find contrasting differences across such groups. First, phylogenetic signal is stronger in antagonistic webs than in mutualistic webs. Second, resources are more strongly constrained than consumers in food webs, while animals show more constraints than plants in mutualistic networks. Third, phylogenetic constraints are stronger for the matching component than for the centrality component of network structure. These results can shed light on the contrasting evolutionary constraints shaping network structure across interaction types and species sets.},

Unfortunately, we know little about the nutritional requirements of different bee species.

This is widely accepted as one of the major drivers of pollinator declines, but few studies have directly addressed the effects of dietary restrictions on pollinator fitness. Here, we investigated the effects of restricting pollen and nectar supply on bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) colony growth, adult size and number. Colonies required up to 6 g pollen/1 g protein and 50 g sugar to establish a colony of 5 workers, and consumed in excess of 176 g pollen/31 g protein and 1,186 g sugar in their lifetime. Regardless of restrictions on pollen or nectar availability, colonies consumed a ratio of 1 g protein to 43 g sugar, though free-flying colonies require proportionally more sugar to fuel foraging. Food-limited colonies from an early stage grew little with anything less than ad-lib nectar, while more-established colonies increased in weight even with low levels of nectar suggesting a shortage of resources in early spring may be most damaging to bumble bee colonies. Dietary restriction reduced the number of reproductives produced, but had variable effects on the size of workers and males. Nosema ceranae infection was included as a covariate in analyses and had a significant negative effect on colony growth. This study provides a base line for the developmental requirements of bumble bee colonies, and indicates the effects a resource deficit may have on their development and reproduction.},

	abstract = {Honey bee colonies are highly dependent upon the availability of floral resources from which they get the nutrients (notably pollen) necessary to their development and survival. However, foraging areas are currently affected by the intensification of agriculture and landscape alteration. Bees are therefore confronted to disparities in time and space of floral resource abundance, type and diversity, which might provide inadequate nutrition and endanger colonies. The beneficial influence of pollen availability on bee health is well-established but whether quality and diversity of pollen diets can modify bee health remains largely unknown. We therefore tested the influence of pollen diet quality (different monofloral pollens) and diversity (polyfloral pollen diet) on the physiology of young nurse bees, which have a distinct nutritional physiology (e.g. hypopharyngeal gland development and vitellogenin level), and on the tolerance to the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae by measuring bee survival and the activity of different enzymes potentially involved in bee health and defense response (glutathione-S-transferase (detoxification), phenoloxidase (immunity) and alkaline phosphatase (metabolism)). We found that both nurse bee physiology and the tolerance to the parasite were affected by pollen quality. Pollen diet diversity had no effect on the nurse bee physiology and the survival of healthy bees. However, when parasitized, bees fed with the polyfloral blend lived longer than bees fed with monofloral pollens, excepted for the protein-richest monofloral pollen. Furthermore, the survival was positively correlated to alkaline phosphatase activity in healthy bees and to phenoloxydase activities in infected bees. Our results support the idea that both the quality and diversity (in a specific context) of pollen can shape bee physiology and might help to better understand the influence of agriculture and land-use intensification on bee nutrition and health.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about the quantitative pollen requirements of solitary bees is crucial for the preservation of endangered bee species and the understanding of the evolution of bee–flower relationships. We estimate the number of flowers required to rear a single larva for 41 European bee species (i) by comparing the pollen content of brood cells with the pollen quantity contained in the flowers of the bees’ host plants and (ii) by deducing the pollen requirements from a regression model describing the relationship between the average bee dry body mass and the average brood cell pollen content. The flower requirements of the bee species examined vary by three orders of magnitude. Depending on both bee species and host plant, from seven to 1100 flowers or from 0.9 to 4.5 flower heads are needed to rear a single larva. As only about 40\% of the pollen contained in a flower was found to be available to a single female bee, these minimal figures have to be multiplied by a factor of approximately 2.5 to obtain a realistic estimate of bee flower requirements. The amount of pollen lost from flowers for bee nutrition is surprisingly high. We hypothesize that the recent decline of many bee species may have its main cause in a food shortage provoked by a decrease in flower diversity and quantity following habitat destruction and modern agricultural practices. The substantial pollen losses to bees as documented in this study support earlier findings on floral adaptations against excessive pollen harvesting by bees.},

	abstract = {In 2013, an opportunity arose in England to develop an agri-environment package for wild pollinators, as part of the new Countryside Stewardship scheme launched in 2015. It can be understood as a ‘policy window’, a rare and time-limited opportunity to change policy, supported by a narrative about pollinator decline and widely supported mitigating actions. An agri-environment package is a bundle of management options that together supply sufficient resources to support a target group of species. This paper documents information that was available at the time to develop such a package for wild pollinators. Four questions needed answering: (1) Which pollinator species should be targeted? (2) Which resources limit these species in farmland? (3) Which management options provide these resources? (4) What area of each option is needed to support populations of the target species? Focussing on wild bees, we provide tentative answers that were used to inform development of the package. There is strong evidence that floral resources can limit wild bee populations, and several sources of evidence identify a set of agri-environment options that provide flowers and other resources for pollinators. The final question could only be answered for floral resources, with a wide range of uncertainty. We show that the areas of some floral resource options in the basic Wild Pollinator and Farmland Wildlife Package (2\% flower-rich habitat and 1 km flowering hedgerow), are sufficient to supply a set of six common pollinator species with enough pollen to feed their larvae at lowest estimates, using minimum values for estimated parameters where a range was available. We identify key sources of uncertainty, and stress the importance of keeping the Package flexible, so it can be revised as new evidence emerges about how to achieve the policy aim of supporting pollinators on farmland.},

	abstract = {In intensive farmland habitats, pollination of wild flowers and crops may be threatened by the widespread decline of pollinators. The honey bee decline, in particular, appears to result from the combination of multiple stresses, including diseases, pathogens, and pesticides. The reduction of semi?natural habitats is also suspected to entail floral resource scarcity for bees. Yet, the seasonal dynamics and composition of the honey bee diet remains poorly documented to date. In this study, we studied the seasonal contribution of mass?flowering crops (rapeseed and sunflower) vs. other floral resources, as well as the influence of nutritional quality and landscape composition on pollen diet composition over five consecutive years. From April to October, the mass of pollen and nectar collected by honey bees followed a bimodal seasonal trend, marked by a two?month period of low food supply between the two oilseed crop mass?flowerings (ending in May for rapeseed and July for sunflower). Bees collected nectar mainly from crops while pollen came from a wide diversity of herbaceous and woody plant species in semi?natural habitats or from weeds in crops. Weed species constituted the bulk of the honey bee diet between the mass flowering crop periods (up to 40\%) and are therefore suspected to play a critical role at this time period. The pollen diet composition was related to the nutritional value of the collected pollen and by the local landscape composition. Our study highlights (1) a food supply depletion period of both pollen and nectar resources during late spring, contemporaneously with the demographic peak of honey bee populations, (2) a high botanical richness of pollen diet, mostly proceeding from trees and weeds, and (3) a pollen diet composition influenced by the local landscape composition. Our results therefore support the Agri?Environmental Schemes intended to promote honey bees and beekeeping sustainability through the enhancement of flower availability in agricultural landscapes.},

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food, as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets. These results suggest a link between protein nutrition and immunity in honeybees and underscore the critical role of resource availability on pollinator health.},

	abstract = {Summary Pollination services from wild insects contribute to crop productivity around the world, but are at risk of decline in agricultural landscapes. Using highbush blueberry as a model system, we tested whether wildflower plantings established adjacent to crop fields would increase the abundance of wild pollinators during crop bloom and enhance pollination and yield. Plantings were seeded in 2009 with a mix of 15 perennial wildflower species that provided season?long bloom and increased plant density and floral area during the subsequent 3 years. Honeybees visiting blueberry flowers had similar abundance in enhanced and control fields in all 4 years of this study, whereas wild bee and syrphid abundance increased annually in the fields adjacent to wildflower plantings. Crop pollination parameters including percentage fruit set, berry weight and mature seeds per berry were significantly greater in fields adjacent to wildflower plantings 3 and 4 years after seeding, leading to higher crop yields and with the associated revenue exceeding the cost of wildflower establishment and maintenance. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that provision of forage habitat for bees adjacent to pollinator?dependent crops can conserve wild pollinators in otherwise resource?poor agricultural landscapes. Over time, these plantings can support higher crop yields and bring a return on the initial investment in wildflower seed and planting establishment, also insuring against loss of managed pollinators. Further understanding of the importance of planting size, location and landscape context will be required to effectively implement this practice to support crop pollination.},

However, the empirical order of species loss with respect to linkage has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, a species’ linkage is a composite of its diet breadth and its abundance, yet the relative importance of these two factors in determining species loss order is poorly known. Here we explore the order of pollinator species loss in two contrasting study systems undergoing land-use intensification, using {\textgreater}20,000 pollinator specimens. We found that a pollinator species’ linkage, as measured independently within plant-pollinator networks, positively predicted its persistence at human-disturbed sites in three of four analyses. The strongest predictor of persistence in all analyses was pollinator species abundance. In contrast, diet breadth poorly predicted persistence. Overall, our results suggest that community disassembly order buffers plant-pollinator networks against environmental change by retaining the highly linked species that make a disproportionate contribution to network robustness. Furthermore, these highly linked species likely persist because they are also the most common species, not because they are dietary generalists.},

This study related differences in three functional traits of pollinating bees (flower height preference, daily time of flower visitation and within-flower behaviour) to the seed set of the obligate cross-pollinated pumpkin Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir. across a land-use intensity gradient from tropical rainforest and agroforests to grassland in Indonesia. Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r2=45\%) than did species richness (r2=32\%) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.},

	abstract = {Understanding population declines has been the objective of a wide range of ecological studies. When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long?standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one?third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable species were. This study shows that natural history collections can play an important role in improving our understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving species population change.},

However, little is known how pollinator diversity could affect pollination services. Using a substitutive design, we experimentally manipulated functional group (FG) and species richness of pollinator communities to investigate their consequences on the reproductive success of an obligate out-crossing model plant species, Raphanus sativus. Both fruit and seed set increased with pollinator FG richness. Furthermore, seed set increased with species richness in pollinator communities composed of a single FG. However, in multiple-FG communities, highest species richness resulted in slightly reduced pollination services compared with intermediate species richness. Our analysis indicates that the presence of social bees, which showed roughly four times higher visitation rates than solitary bees or hoverflies, was an important factor contributing to the positive pollinator diversity–pollination service relationship, in particular, for fruit set. Visitation rate at different daytimes, and less so among flower heights, varied among social bees, solitary bees and hoverflies, indicating a niche complementarity among these pollinator groups. Our study demonstrates enhanced pollination services of diverse pollinator communities at the plant population level and suggests that both the niche complementarity and the presence of specific taxa in a pollinator community drive this positive relationship.},

We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

	abstract = {Despite current concern about the safety of biological control of weeds, assessing the indirect impacts of introduced agents is not common practice. Using 17 replicate food webs, we demonstrate that the use of a highly host-plant specific weed biocontrol agent, recently introduced into Australia, is associated with declines of local insect communities. The agent shares natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) with seed herbivore species from native plants, so apparent competition is the most likely cause for these losses. Both species richness and abundance in insect communities (seed herbivores and their parasitoids) were negatively correlated with the abundance of the biocontrol agent. Local losses of up to 11 species (dipteran seed herbivores and parasitoids) took place as the biocontrol agent abundance increased. Ineffective biocontrol agents that remain highly abundant in the community are most likely to have persistent, indirect negative effects. Our findings suggest that more investment is required in pre-release studies on the effectiveness of biocontrol agents, as well as in post-release studies assessing indirect impacts, to avoid or minimize the release of potentially damaging species.},

Disturbance is usually believed to affect specialists negatively, while generalists are believed to benefit from disturbance; we call this the “specialization‐disturbance” hypothesis. We also propose an associated hypothesis (the “specialization‐asymmetry‐disturbance” hypothesis) under which both specialization and asymmetry of interactions would explain species’ responses to disturbance. We test these hypotheses using data from a plant‐pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle (i.e., a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization of interaction partners, and species’ responses to disturbance. We found no relationship between degree of specialization and a species’ response to disturbance. We also found that plant‐pollinator interactions tend to be asymmetric in this system; there was no relationship between the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species’ responses to disturbance. Thus, both hypotheses are rejected by our data. Possible reasons include failure to assess crucial resources, substantial direct effects of disturbance, inaccurate measures of specialization, difficulty detecting highly nonlinear relationships, and limitations of a nonexperimental approach. Or, in fact, there may be no relationship between specialization and response to disturbance.},

Ecological networks provide a valuable tool to explore such impacts at the community level, and can be particularly insightful for planning and monitoring biocontrol programmes, including the potential for their seldom evaluated indirect non-target effects. Acacia longifolia is among the worst invasive species in Portugal, and has been recently targeted for biocontrol by a highly specific gall-wasp. Here we use an ambitious replicated network approach to: (1) identify the mechanisms by which direct and indirect impacts of A. longifolia can cascade from plants to higher trophic levels, including gallers, their parasitoids and inquilines; (2) reveal the structure of the interaction networks between plants, gallers, parasitoids and inquilines before the biocontrol; and (3) explore the potential for indirect interactions among gallers, including those established with the biocontrol agent, via apparent competition. Over a 15-month period, we collected 31,737 galls from native plants and identified all emerging insects, quantifying the interactions between 219 plant-, 49 galler-, 65 parasitoid-and 87 inquiline-species-one of the largest ecological networks to date. No galls were found on any of the 16 alien plant species. Invasion by A. longifolia caused an alarming simplification of plant communities, with cascading effects to higher trophic levels, namely: a decline of overall gall biomass, and on the richness, abundance and biomass of galler insects, their parasitoids, and inquilines. Correspondingly, we detected a significant decline in the richness of interactions between plants and galls. The invasion tended to increase overall interaction evenness by promoting the local extinction of the native plants that sustained more gall species. However, highly idiosyncratic responses hindered the detection of further consistent changes in network topology. Predictions of indirect effects of the biocontrol on native gallers via apparent competition ranged from negligible to highly significant. Such scenarios are incredibly hard to predict, but even if there are risks of indirect effects it is critical to weigh them carefully against the consequences of inaction and invasive species spread.},

If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant–pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant–pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies on naturally occurring plant species have shown that plant-plant interactions for pollination vary from competitive to facilitative. In reviewing the seven published studies on how alien species can affect the pollination success in natives, we found that all authors suggest competitive effects to dominate, either through reduced pollinator visitation rates or through increased heterospecific pollination of native flowers. Although certain pollinator interactions were competitive, the reproductive output in the native species was not always reduced. This implies that natives are not pollen limited, and/or that they compensate for the loss of pollinators by other animals. However, the few studies on pollination interactions between alien and native plant species show differing results. We therefore discuss other properties that can cause aliens to be strong interactors for pollination, and can modify how alien species affect the reproductive success in natives. We also emphasize the spatial scales addressed in the reviewed studies, as alien plant species may represent valuable food resources for many pollinators. Such plant species tend to be interpreted as competitive plants for pollination, whereas we stress their facilitative ability that may occur on a landscape scale by increasing pollinator densities. Additionally, while most studies tend to work within a shorter temporal scale, the impacts of the alien plant introductions may differ depending on the year or seasonal time leading to the differing results reported.},

Using a conventional and a phylogenetically controlled meta-analytical approach on a data set of 40 studies, we evaluated the effect of alien neighbour plant species (aliens) on visitation to and reproduction of native co-flowering focal species (focals), and compared such effect to that of native neighbours (natives). An overall significantly negative effect of aliens on visitation to and reproduction of focals was confirmed. Interestingly, aliens differed from natives in their effect on visitation, but not on reproductive success. The negative effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success increased at high relative alien plant abundance, but this increase was proportionally lower than the increase in relative plant abundance. Likewise, effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success was most detrimental when alien and focal species had similar flower symmetry or colour. The phylogenetic relatedness between alien neighbours and focals influenced the reproductive success effect size. Results of the phylogenetic meta-analysis were only partly consistent with those of the conventional meta-analysis, depending on the response variable and on whether we controlled for the phylogeny of neighbour or focal species, which calls for special attention to control for species relatedness in this type of review. This study demonstrates the predominant detrimental impact of alien plants on pollination and reproduction of natives, and highlights the importance of phenotypic similarity to the outcome of the interaction.},

	abstract = {Beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems provide humans with many invaluable ecosystem services including crop pollination and pest control. The creation of wildflower strips has emerged as a key tool to conserve beneficial insect groups in these systems. Yet, the efficacy of these schemes in delivering multiple ecosystem services is usually limited by our poor understanding of how plant species composition, functional traits and trait diversity affect insect visitation and resource use. Here we investigate the effects of plant floral traits and trait diversity on flower visitation by three functionally distinct beneficial insect groups, which provide crop pollination and pest control services: bumblebees, hoverflies and parasitoid wasps. We created plots that contained plants with either long or short-corolla flowers, as well as mixed plots, which contained plants presenting both floral traits concurrently. In functionally simple plots, insect groups exhibited distinct floral associations, with bumblebees being almost exclusively associated with long-corolla flower plots, whereas parasitoids and hoverflies strongly favoured plots with short-corolla flowers. When these flower types were planted in combination (mixed-trait plots), bumblebee and hoverfly visitation was maintained at the level of their respective preferred single-trait plot, but parasitoid visitation was reduced by 50\%. Thus, the informed selection of functionally diverse flower patches can be an effective tool to attract a higher diversity of insect groups than functionally simple plots. However, this may increase interference competition between visitors and limit the value of floral resources for beneficials that are weak competitors.
Zusammenfassung
In Agrarökosystemen stellen nützliche Insekten viele unschätzbare Ökosystemfunktionen zur Verfügung, wie die Bestäubung von Nutzpflanzen und die Schädlingskontrolle. Die Schaffung von blühenden Ackerrandstreifen kam als eine wichtige Methode auf, um nützliche Insektengruppen in diesen Systemen zu bewahren. Dennoch ist die Wirksamkeit dieser Methode in Bezug auf die Bereitstellung der Ökosystemfunktionen normalerweise beschränkt, da es nur ein geringes Wissen darüber gibt, wie die Pflanzenartenzusammensetzung, die funktionalen Eigenschaften und die Diversität der Pflanzeneigenschaften die Besuche von Insekten und die Ressourcennutzung beeinflussen. Hier untersuchen wir die Auswirkungen der Eigenschaften von Blüten und der Diversität der Pflanzeneigenschaften auf den Blütenbesuch von drei Gruppen funktional unterschiedlicher, nützlicher Insekten, die eine Nutzpflanzenbestäubung oder eine Schädlingskontrolle zur Verfügung stellen: Hummeln, Schwebfliegen und parasitoide Wespen. Wir legten Versuchsflächen an, die entweder Pflanzen mit langen oder kurzen Blütenröhren besaßen und gemischte Probeflächen die gleichermaßen Pflanzen mit kurz- bzw. langröhrigen Blüten enthielten. In den funktional einfachen Probeflächen zeigten die Insektengruppen bestimmte Blütenassoziationen, wobei die Hummeln fast ausschließlich mit den Flächen mit langen Blütenröhren assoziiert waren, während die Parasitoide und Schwebfliegen stark die Probeflächen mit kurzröhrigen Blüten bevorzugten. Wenn diese Pflanzentypen in Kombinationen gepflanzt wurden (Probeflächen mit gemischten Eigenschaften), wurde der Besuch durch Hummeln und Schwebfliegen nicht beeinflusst, der Besuch durch Parasitoide war jedoch um 50\% gegenüber der bevorzugten Probefläche mit einfacher Eigenschaft reduziert. Deshalb kann die bewusste Auswahl von funktional verschiedenen Pflanzen auf den Flächen im Gegensatz zu funktional einfachen Flächen ein effektives Werkzeug sein, um eine höhere Diversität von Insektengruppen anzuziehen. Dies könnte jedoch auch die Konkurrenz zwischen den Besuchern erhöhen und damit den Wert der Blütenressourcen für diejenigen Nützlinge vermindern, die schwache Konkurrenten sind.},

	abstract = {Recovering biological diversity and ecosystem functioning are primary objectives of ecological restoration, yet these outcomes are often unpredictable. Assessments based on functional traits may help with interpreting variability in both community composition and ecosystem functioning because of their mechanistic and generalizable nature. This promise remains poorly realized, however, because tests linking environmental conditions, functional traits, and ecosystem functioning in restoration are rare. Here, we provide such a test through what is to our knowledge the first empirical application of the ‘response–effect trait framework’ to restoration. This framework provides a trait-based bridge between community assembly and ecosystem functioning by describing how species respond to environmental conditions based on traits and how the traits of species affect ecosystem functioning. Our study took place across 29 prairies restored from former agricultural fields in southwestern Michigan. We considered how environmental conditions affect ecosystem functioning through and independently of measured functional traits. To do so, we paired field-collected trait data with data on plant community composition and measures of ecosystem functioning and used structural equation modelling to determine relationships between environmental conditions, community-weighted means of functional traits and ecosystem functioning. Environmental conditions were predictive of trait composition. Sites restored directly from tillage (as opposed to those allowed to fallow) supported taller species with larger seeds and higher specific leaf area (SLA). Site age and fire frequency were both negatively related to SLA. We also found a positive relationship between soil moisture and SLA. Both trait composition and environmental conditions predicted ecosystem functioning, but these relationships varied among the measured functions. Pollination mode (animal pollination) increased and fire frequency decreased floral resource availability, seed mass had a negative effect on below-ground biomass production, and vegetative height increased decomposition rate. Soil moisture and fire frequency both increased while site age decreased above-ground biomass production, and site age and soil moisture both increased decomposition rate. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both trait composition and environmental conditions play a role in shaping ecosystem function during restoration, and the importance of each is dependent on the function of interest. Because of this, environmental heterogeneity will be necessary to promote multiple ecosystem functions across restored landscapes. A trait-based approach to restoration can aid interpretation of variable outcomes through insights into community assembly and ecosystem functioning.},

In many species, individuals visit foraging patches in predictable sequences called traplines. However, whether and how they optimize their routes remains poorly understood. 2. In this study, we demonstrate that traplining bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) make a trade-off between minimizing travel distance and prioritizing the most rewarding feeding locations. 3. Individual bees trained to forage on five artificial flowers of equal reward value selected the shortest possible route as a trapline. After introducing a single highly rewarding flower to the array, they re-adjusted their routes visiting the most rewarding flower first provided the departure distance from the shortest possible route remained small (18\%). When routes optimizing the initial rate of reward intake were much longer (42\%), bees prioritized short travel distances. 4. Under natural conditions, in which individual flowers vary in nectar productivity and replenish continuously, it might pay bees to prioritize highly rewarding locations, both to minimize the overall number of flowers to visit and to beat competitors. 5. We discuss how combined memories of location and quality of resource patches could allow bees and other traplining animals to optimize their routing decisions in heterogeneous environments.},

We explored the consequences that simple linkage rules based on the first two hypotheses (complementarity of traits versus barriers to exploitation) had on the topology of plant–pollination networks. Independent of the linkage rules used, the inclusion of a small set of traits (two to four) sufficed to account for the complex topological patterns observed in real-world networks. Optimal performance was achieved by a “mixed model” that combined rules that link plants and pollinators whose trait ranges overlap (“complementarity models”) and rules that link pollinators to flowers whose traits are below a pollinator-specific barrier value (“barrier models”). Deterrence of floral parasites (barrier model) is therefore at least as important as increasing pollination efficiency (complementarity model) in the evolutionary shaping of plant–pollinator networks.},

	abstract = {The analysis of mutualistic networks has become a central tool in answering theoretical and applied questions regarding our understanding of ecological processes. Significant gaps in knowledge do however need to be bridged in order to effectively and accurately be able to describe networks. Main concern are the incorporation of species level information, accounting for sampling limitations and understanding linkage rules. Here I propose a simple method to combine plant pollinator effort-limited sampling with information about plant community to gain understanding of what drives linkage rules, while accounting for possible undetected linkages. I use hierarchical models to estimate the probability of detection of each plant-pollinator interaction in 12 Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. As it is possible to incorporate plant traits as co-variables in the models, this method has the potential to be used for predictive purposes, such as identifying undetected links among existing species, as well as potential interactions with new plant species. Results show that pollinator detectability is very skewed and usually low. Nevertheless, 84\% of the models are enhanced by the inclusion of co-variables, with flower abundance and inflorescence type being the most commonly retained co-variables. The predicted networks increase network Connectance by 13\%, but not Nestedness, which is known to be robust to sampling effects. However, 46\% of the pollinator interactions in the studied networks comprised a single observation and hence could not be modeled. The hierarchical modeling approach suggested here is highly flexible and can be used on binary or frequency networks, accommodate different observers or include collection day weather variables as confounding factors. An R script is provided for a rapid adoption of this method.},

	abstract = {Flowers exhibit great intra-specific variation in the rewards they offer. At any one time, a significant proportion of flowers often contain little or no reward. Hence, foraging profitably for floral rewards is problematic and any ability to discriminate between flowers and avoid those that are less rewarding will confer great advantages. In this study, we examine discrimination by foraging bees among flowers of nasturtium, Tropaeolum majus. Bee visitors included carpenter bees, Xylocopa violacea, which were primary nectar robbers; honeybees, Apis mellifera, which either acted as secondary nectar robbers or gathered pollen legitimately and bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, which were the only bees able to gather nectar legitimately. Many flowers were damaged by phytophagous insects. Nectar volume was markedly lower in flowers with damaged petals (which were also likely to be older) and in flowers that had nectar-robbing holes. We test whether bees exhibit selectivity with regards to the individual flowers, which they approach and enter, and whether this selectivity enhances foraging efficiency. The flowers approached (within 2 cm) by A. mellifera and B. hortorum were non-random when compared to the floral population; both species selectively approached un-blemished flowers. They both approached more yellow flowers than would be expected by chance, presumably a reflection of innate colour preferences, for nectar standing crop did not vary according to flower colour. Bees were also more likely to accept (land on) un-blemished flowers. A. mellifera gathering nectar exhibited selectivity with regards to the presence of robbing holes, being more likely to land on robbed flowers (they are not able to feed on un-robbed flowers). That they frequently approached un-robbed flowers suggests that they are not able to detect robbing holes at long-range, so that foraging efficiency may be limited by visual acuity. Nevertheless, by using a combination of long-range and short-range selectivity, nectar-gathering A. mellifera and B. hortorum greatly increased the average reward from the flowers on which they landed (by 68\% and 48\%, respectively) compared to the average standing crop in the flower population. Overall, our results demonstrate that bees use obvious floral cues (colour and petal blemishes) at long-range, but can switch to using more subtle cues (robbing holes) at close range. They also make many mistakes and some cues used do not correlate with floral rewards.},

	abstract = {Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by “planned” and “associated” biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.},

Creating patches with high plant diversity within farmland is commonly suggested as a measure to benefit pollinators. However, farmers rarely adopt such practice, instead removing naturally occurring plants (weeds). By combining pollinator exclusion experiments with analysis of honeybee behaviour and flower-visitation webs, we found that the presence of weeds allowed pollinators to persist within sunflower fields, maximizing the benefits of the remaining patches of natural habitat to productivity of this large-scale crop. Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat. Although honeybees were the most abundant visitors, diversity of flower visitors enhanced honeybee movement, being the main factor influencing productivity. Conservation of natural patches combined with promoting flowering plants within crops can maximize productivity and, therefore, reduce the need for cropland expansion, contributing towards sustainable agriculture.},

In this study we surveyed pollinators on the mass-flowering perennial crop coffee (Coffea arabica) in its native range in Ethiopia. Previous studies in areas where coffee is introduced often find the social honeybee, Apis mellifera, to be the dominant pollinator. In those areas, the bee-species composition visiting coffee varies with a higher bee diversity closer to forest or in less modified habitats. We surveyed pollinators of coffee under different shade-tree structures, by collecting hoverflies and bees landing on coffee flowers in 19 sites in south-west Ethiopia. We found the native honeybee (A. mellifera) to be the dominant visitor of coffee flowers in all sites. Honeybee abundance was not affected by the local shade-tree structure, but was positively affected by the amount of coffee flower resources. Other pollinators were positively affected by complex shade-tree structures. To conclude, the honeybee is clearly the dominant pollinator of coffee in Ethiopia along the whole shade-tree structure gradient. Its high abundance could be a consequence of the provision of traditional bee hives in the landscape, which are colonized by wild swarming honeybees.},

We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance.

	abstract = {Competition for floral resources is a key force shaping pollinator communities, particularly among social bees. The ability of social bees to recruit nestmates for group foraging is hypothesized to be a major factor in their ability to dominate rich resources such as mass-flowering trees. We tested the role of group foraging in attaining dominance by stingless bees, eusocial tropical pollinators that exhibit high diversity in foraging strategies. We provide the first experimental evidence that meliponine group foraging strategies, large colony sizes and aggressive behavior form a suite of traits that enable colonies to improve dominance of rich resources. Using a diverse assemblage of Brazilian stingless bee species and an array of artificial “flowers” that provided a sucrose reward, we compared species’ dominance and visitation under unrestricted foraging conditions and with experimental removal of group-foraging species. Dominance does not vary with individual body size, but rather with foraging group size. Species that recruit larger numbers of nestmates (Scaptotrigona aff. depilis, Trigona hyalinata, Trigona spinipes) dominated both numerically (high local abundance) and behaviorally (controlling feeders). Removal of group-foraging species increased feeding opportunities for solitary foragers (Frieseomelitta varia, Melipona quadrifasciata and Nannotrigona testaceicornis). Trigona hyalinata always dominated under unrestricted conditions. When this species was removed, T. spinipes or S. aff. depilis controlled feeders and limited visitation by solitary-foraging species. Because bee foraging patterns determine plant pollination success, understanding the forces that shape these patterns is crucial to ensuring pollination of both crops and natural areas in the face of current pollinator declines.},

It has been in a state of abandonment and destruction since the late 1960s. In 2000, the Japanese government initiated a new environment policy encouraging the use of Satoyama in biodiversity reservation areas. Before the initiation of active restoration works, an assessment of the potential of the Satoyama system is needed. To assess this potential, a study that focused on the foraging ecology of wild bees in a small abandoned Satoyama terraced paddy was carried out from June to October 2003. A total of 372 foraging bees belonging to 35 species in nine families was collected: two species of social bee (Apis cerana and Bombus diversus) and two of solitary bee (Lasioglossum japonicum and Lasioglossum ohei) dominated. The foraging activities of wild bees were highly influenced by the requirement of food for the colony and the active time of solitary bees. In the study, most wild bees showed a strong preference for abundant flowering plant species that produced a large number of flowers (Achyranthes japonica and Polygonum thunbergii). The results showed that an abandoned Satoyama system was an agricultural system that benefited pollinating bees. Careful and planned restoration practices to increase the diversity of foraging resources, microenvironment diversity and potential nesting areas for wild bees are needed to improve the ability of the Satoyama system to support more diverse and abundant wild bee populations.},

	abstract = {An on-farm pollination experiment was conducted during the June–August and November–February blooming seasons of 2007 to 2008, in 30 small-scale coffee fields characterised by different habitat and vegetation types. The study was conducted in order to determine the best pollinator groups for coffee in Uganda and to collect relevant field information and determine the pollination efficiency of different bee species. Results indicate that across blooming seasons, coffee flowers were visited by 24–36 bee species. Hypotrigona gribodoi was the most frequent flower visitor, comprising over 60\% of 5941 bee-visits recorded. Foraging rate and pollination speed varied among bee species. Solitary bees foraged on more flowers than social bees, but they spent less time per flower visited. Solitary bees visited more coffee trees and fields, but deposited less pollen, whereas social bees visited less trees and coffee fields in the landscape, but deposited more pollen on flowers. Fruit set was of 87\%, 64\% and 0.9\%, respectively, in hand-cross pollination, open pollination and controlled-pollination treatments. Fruit abortion due to self-pollination was insignificant in this study. There was variability in pollination efficiency of different bee species. Pollination efficiency varied more significantly with sociality than with other bee functional traits and was not significantly influenced by tongue length and bee body size. Single-flower visits by social and solitary bees resulted in 89.7\% and 68.14\% fruit set, respectively. The most efficient bee species was Meliponula ferruginea (98.3\%) followed by Meliponula nebulata (97.1\%). Thus, very good pollinator species were wild social bees (mainly stingless bees) as opposed to honeybees and solitary bees that were previously reported to be the best pollinators of coffee in Panama and Indonesia. Morphological and anatomical characteristics of the bee pollen storage features may explain the difference in foraging behaviour activities and in pollination efficiency of social and solitary afrotropical bee species visiting lowland coffee in Uganda. In addition, pollination efficiency was influenced by land-use intensity, field management systems and habitat types found in the immediate surroundings of coffee fields, but not by coffee field size, coffee genotypes and mass blooming wild vegetation. It is recommended to farmers to adopt pollinator-friendly conservation and farming practices such as keeping an uncultivated portion (25\%–30\%) of their farms as pollinator reservoirs, protecting semi-natural habitats found in the vicinity of coffee fields, as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to benefit a functionally diverse pollinator community.},

Stepwise multiple regressions were used to investigate the effects of light intensity, distance to forest, foraging time of the day, coffee blooming season and abundance of coffee floral resources on the flower visitation frequency of different bee species. Results indicated contrasting responses of different bee species.

	abstract = {Land degradation results in declining biodiversity and the disruption of ecosystem functioning worldwide, particularly in the tropics1. Vegetation restoration is a common tool used to mitigate these impacts and increasingly aims to restore ecosystem functions rather than species diversity2. However, evidence from community experiments on the effect of restoration practices on ecosystem functions is scarce3. Pollination is an important ecosystem function and the global decline in pollinators attenuates the resistance of natural areas and agro-environments to disturbances4. Thus, the ability of pollination functions to resist or recover from disturbance (that is, the functional resilience)5,6 may be critical for ensuring a successful restoration process7. Here we report the use of a community field experiment to investigate the effects of vegetation restoration, specifically the removal of exotic shrubs, on pollination. We analyse 64 plant–pollinator networks and the reproductive performance of the ten most abundant plant species across four restored and four unrestored, disturbed mountaintop communities. Ecosystem restoration resulted in a marked increase in pollinator species, visits to flowers and interaction diversity. Interactions in restored networks were more generalized than in unrestored networks, indicating a higher functional redundancy in restored communities. Shifts in interaction patterns had direct and positive effects on pollination, especially on the relative and total fruit production of native plants. Pollinator limitation was prevalent at unrestored sites only, where the proportion of flowers producing fruit increased with pollinator visitation, approaching the higher levels seen in restored plant communities. Our results show that vegetation restoration can improve pollination, suggesting that the degradation of ecosystem functions is at least partially reversible. The degree of recovery may depend on the state of degradation before restoration intervention and the proximity to pollinator source populations in the surrounding landscape5,8. We demonstrate that network structure is a suitable indicator for pollination quality, highlighting the usefulness of interaction networks in environmental management6,9.},

	abstract = {SummaryThe life cycle and social behaviour of the sweat bee Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) baleicum (Cockerell) was investigated in two geographically separate populations in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Colonies were excavated throughout the brood rearing season from an aggregation in Nishioka forest park, Sapporo, and near Kawakita in eastern Hokkaido during 2000 and 2001. The Nishioka population produced two discrete broods during the year and was weakly eusocial; 57\% of workers were mated and 28\% exhibited some ovarian development, 12–16\% of the first brood was male, and workers were on average 4.5\% smaller than their respective queen. In contrast, the population at Kawakita was solitary, and produced a single brood per year with an unbiased sex ratio. In addition however, there were some solitary colonies in the Nishioka population and evidence of a partial second brood in some colonies at Kawakita, suggesting differences between the populations are not fixed and that this species is truly socially polymorphic. L. (E.) baleicum is a member of the fulvicorne species group, which includes other examples of social polymorphic species as well as solitary and eusocial species, though this is the only species of this group so far known to exhibit a solitary/non-delayed eusocial polymorphism. Recent studies suggest that social polymorphism has both genetic and environmental influences, raising questions as to the relative import of each.},

Effects of robbing on female and male components of plant reproduction range from negative to positive. Their underlying mechanisms are diverse, including direct effects and indirect effects mediated through changes in pollination. We detail how plants may be able to deter robbers through morphological and chemical traits. For the evolutionary ecology of robbing to move beyond a phytocentric perspective, studies must also address the causes of robbing and the consequences for both robbers and pollinators. We use an energetics approach to evaluate these causes and consequences. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions in need of further research.},

	abstract = {Nectar robbers use a hole made in the perianth to extract nectar. Since robbers may modify plant fitness, they play an important role by driving evolution on floral traits, shaping population structure and influencing community dynamics. Although nectar robbing is widespread in angiosperms, the causes and ecological implications of this behaviour on large ecological scales are still unexplored. Our aim is to study the frequency of nectar robbing in plants of temperate and tropical regions and examine its association with plant traits. We characterised the levels of nectar robbing in 88 species of Mediterranean, Alpine, Antillean and Andean plant communities and identified the most important nectar robbers. We analysed associations between the levels of robbing and floral morphology, production and density of energy rewards, mechanisms of protection against nectar robbers, plant life form and geographic origin. Nectar robbing was present at all sampling sites. Within communities two patterns of robbing levels related to the diversity and specialization of robbers were detected. In most communities one plant species presented very high levels of robbing while other species had intermediate to low robbing levels. There, nectar robbers are opportunists, robbing highly rewarding plants. In the Andean community the high specialization of several co-existing flowerpiercers produced an even pattern of robbing levels in the plant community. Plants with long flowers, abundant nectar and a high energy density are more likely to be robbed by both insects and birds. A high aggregation of the flowers within the plants and the presence of long calyxes and bracts are associated to low robbing rates by insects and to a lesser extent by birds. Besides the morphological constraints that operate on a single flower basis, nectar robbing is a phenomenon dependent upon the density of energy rewards reflecting the presence of mechanisms on higher ecological scales.},

We examined mean thorax widths (a reliable measure of body size) of workers of Bombus pascuorum, B. lucorum, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris at sites with and without honeybees. Workers of all four species were significantly smaller in areas with honeybees. We suggest that reduced worker size is likely to have implications for bumblebee colony success.

Experiments were performed to compare the foraging tactics of this invading species to those of its most abundant competitors, highly social stingless bees of the genera Melipona and Trigona. In an area containing a rich assemblage of stingless bees in French Guiana, Africanized honeybees were significantly more abundant on honey—water feeders during a high 'nectar flow' period than combined stingless bee and wasp species. During the last 15 min of the experiments, when bait was not replenished on feeders, Africanized honeybees abandoned the feeders but native foragers continued to arrive. None of the stingless bees, including four aggressive Trigona, displaced from the feeders the foragers of several (two to seven) colonies of Africanized honeybees. The cost of attacking Africanized honeybees at feeders apparently exceeded the benefit for large, aggressive Trigona williana and T. hyalinata branneri. These bees abandoned feeders visited by nonaggressive Africanized honeybees. Single, small Africanized honeybee colonies were displaced from feeders by aggressive foragers of T. Pallens pallens and T. h. branneri. In one instance Africanized honeybeeys shifted almost immediately to a floral resource, while abandonment of the feeders by T. williana was not followed by a shift to a natural food source. Reduction of competitive interaction with Africanized honeybees was accomplished by foragers of T. clavipes and T. p. pallens that partitioned four feeders by visiting only two, leaving the other to Africanized bees. Interspecific displacement was never absolute; a few foragers from a displaced colony always visited the feeders. Africanized honeybees and Melipona fulva foraged nonaggressively both at feeders and flowers, but Africanized bees at feeders exhibited low levels of aggression toward Melipona and polybiine wasps on one occasion. Unlike other aggressive Trigona, T. clavipes was at times unaggressive. Colonies of T. h. branneri and Africanized honeybees, the bees most successful in displacing other species from feeders, were comprised of many more workers than colonies of the other bees. The combined advantages of (1) the ability to communicate the distance and direction of a food source from the nest, (2) large forager size, and (3) large colony size provide Africanized honeybee colonies with a competitive ability superior to that of stingless bees at rich, compact resources.},

	abstract = {The role of biodiversity in the delivery of ecosystem services is increasingly being studied by trait-based functional approaches. Here, we review and discuss the contribution of a trait-based approach to understanding plant–arthropod interactions and improving conservation biological control. The stable biological control of multispecies herbivore communities requires functional diversity and a redundancy of natural enemies, including specialists and generalists, with minimal antagonistic interactions. The management of arthropod communities through plant community requires the plant community to perform several functions, including the provision of diversified trophic resources and appropriate physical habitats. Many studies have investigated the ability of plants to provide these functions, but many of the results obtained were limited to single species. The description of communities in terms of traits underlying trophic and non-trophic interactions between plants and animals would make it possible to extrapolate findings to other species. Studies on plant–herbivore and plant–pollinator interactions have identified several traits as important for trophic resource provision, in terms of resource quantity, accessibility, quality and temporal availability. By contrast, traits relating to physical habitat provision and microclimate modification have been little explored. Several metrics describing the functional composition and diversity of communities have been proposed, to extend the trait-based approach to plant community level, but the extent to which multitrophic communities are affected by plant traits remains largely unexplored. The next step will be to identify the combinations of these plant community metrics best explaining their impact on arthropod communities and disentangling the roles of plant functional composition and diversity.},

	abstract = {An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification of the orders and families of angiosperms is presented. Several new orders are recognized: Boraginales, Dilleniales, Icacinales, Metteniusiales and Vahliales. This brings the total number of orders and families recognized in the APG system to 64 and 416, respectively. We propose two additional informal major clades, superrosids and superasterids, that each comprise the additional orders that are included in the larger clades dominated by the rosids and asterids. Families that made up potentially monofamilial orders, Dasypogonaceae and Sabiaceae, are instead referred to Arecales and Proteales, respectively. Two parasitic families formerly of uncertain positions are now placed: Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales and Apodanthaceae in Cucurbitales. Although there is evidence that some families recognized in APG III are not monophyletic, we make no changes in Dioscoreales and Santalales relative to APG III and leave some genera in Lamiales unplaced (e.g. Peltanthera). These changes in familial circumscription and recognition have all resulted from new results published since APG III, except for some changes simply due to nomenclatural issues, which include substituting Asphodelaceae for Xanthorrhoeaceae (Asparagales) and Francoaceae for Melianthaceae (Geraniales); however, in Francoaceae we also include Bersamaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Rhynchothecaceae and Vivianiaceae. Other changes to family limits are not drastic or numerous and are mostly focused on some members of the lamiids, especially the former Icacinaceae that have long been problematic with several genera moved to the formerly monogeneric Metteniusaceae, but minor changes in circumscription include Aristolochiaceae (now including Lactoridaceae and Hydnoraceae; Aristolochiales), Maundiaceae (removed from Juncaginaceae; Alismatales), Restionaceae (now re-including Anarthriaceae and Centrolepidaceae; Poales), Buxaceae (now including Haptanthaceae; Buxales), Peraceae (split from Euphorbiaceae; Malpighiales), recognition of Petenaeaceae (Huerteales), Kewaceae, Limeaceae, Macarthuriaceae and Microteaceae (all Caryophyllales), Petiveriaceae split from Phytolaccaceae (Caryophyllales), changes to the generic composition of Ixonanthaceae and Irvingiaceae (with transfer of Allantospermum from the former to the latter; Malpighiales), transfer of Pakaraimaea (formerly Dipterocarpaceae) to Cistaceae (Malvales), transfer of Borthwickia, Forchhammeria, Stixis and Tirania (formerly all Capparaceae) to Resedaceae (Brassicales), Nyssaceae split from Cornaceae (Cornales), Pteleocarpa moved to Gelsemiaceae (Gentianales), changes to the generic composition of Gesneriaceae (Sanango moved from Loganiaceae) and Orobanchaceae (now including Lindenbergiaceae and Rehmanniaceae) and recognition of Mazaceae distinct from Phrymaceae (all Lamiales).},

Many recent studies have yielded increasingly detailed evidence for the positions of formerly unplaced families, resulting in a number of newly adopted orders, including Amborellales, Berberidopsidales, Bruniales, Buxales, Chloranthales, Escalloniales, Huerteales, Nymphaeales, Paracryphiales, Petrosaviales, Picramniales, Trochodendrales, Vitales and Zygophyllales. A number of previously unplaced genera and families are included here in orders, greatly reducing the number of unplaced taxa; these include Hydatellaceae (Nymphaeales), Haptanthaceae (Buxales), Peridiscaceae (Saxifragales), Huaceae (Oxalidales), Centroplacaceae and Rafflesiaceae (both Malpighiales), Aphloiaceae, Geissolomataceae and Strasburgeriaceae (all Crossosomatales), Picramniaceae (Picramniales), Dipentodontaceae and Gerrardinaceae (both Huerteales), Cytinaceae (Malvales), Balanophoraceae (Santalales), Mitrastemonaceae (Ericales) and Boraginaceae (now at least known to be a member of lamiid clade). Newly segregated families for genera previously understood to be in other APG-recognized families include Petermanniaceae (Liliales), Calophyllaceae (Malpighiales), Capparaceae and Cleomaceae (both Brassicales), Schoepfiaceae (Santalales), Anacampserotaceae, Limeaceae, Lophiocarpaceae, Montiaceae and Talinaceae (all Caryophyllales) and Linderniaceae and Thomandersiaceae (both Lamiales). Use of bracketed families is abandoned because of its unpopularity, and in most cases the broader circumscriptions are retained; these include Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceace and Xanthorrheaceae (all Asparagales), Passifloraceae (Malpighiales), Primulaceae (Ericales) and several other smaller families. Separate papers in this same volume deal with a new linear order for APG, subfamilial names that can be used for more accurate communication in Amaryllidaceae s.l., Asparagaceace s.l. and Xanthorrheaceae s.l.

The phylogenetic signal found in ecological networks suggests that evolution plays an important role in determining community assembly and hence could inform about the underpinning mechanisms. The aim of this study was to review the main findings and methodological approaches used for detecting phylogenetic signal in species interaction networks, particularly in different aspects of network structure: conservatism of interactions, modularity, connectivity and nestedness. In general, studies show that species phylogenies determine interacting partners, module composition, species roles and nested patterns, although these influences are not always consistent across different interaction types. The relative importance of phylogeny to network structure, as well as the scale dependence of phylogenetic signal, denotes key areas for future research. Phylogenetically informed network ecology represents a promising field for understanding species interaction patterns, community assembly processes and dynamics. It can also provide important information for predicting community changes and improving management practices. A lay summary is available for this article.},

	abstract = {There has been an intense focus on the response of species to environmental changes, and more recently, the interactions of species have been examined in a similar way in order to understand the stability of entire communities and networks of interacting species. As a consequence, ecological networks have been placed in spatial and temporal contexts in order to reveal what may drive network variability. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecological networks, and in particular the underlying forces facilitating changes, seems pertinent in our attempts to understand and anticipate how ecological networks may vary and respond to future environmental scenarios. Network variability has been studied at widely differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, studies exploring temporal variability ranges from within-season comparisons to comparisons over vast geological time spans, and the spatial extent ranges from the scale of a single pond to global analyses. Here, we highlight the outcomes from such studies and emphasize the identified mechanisms driving spatio-temporal variability in ecological networks. Specifically, we describe how ecological networks vary over different temporal (years, centuries and millennia) and spatial (local, regional and global) scales, discuss how this variability is monitored and identify potential future directions. Present knowledge allows some tentative generalizations. First, ecological networks tend to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal stability in several macroscopic features (e.g. connectance, nestedness), but studies also show that macroscopic features may change, for example, in relation to mass extinction or steep environmental gradients. Secondly, microscopic features (e.g. individual specialization levels, species roles and partner affiliations), albeit less studied, seem to show strong variability, and in several cases, microscopic instability co-occurs with macroscopic stability. We therefore recommend a stronger focus on this macro–micro interplay and list ideas (e.g. temporal species centrality measures and interaction phenologies), towards expanding the microscopic toolbox of network ecologists.

In this study, we compare the pollinator communities and pollen deposited on stigmas of native plant species within and away from stands of the invasive alien plant, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) at a large natural area in North Dakota, USA. Specifically, we ask if infestation influences (1) visitation rates and taxonomic composition of visitors to native flowers, and (2) the amount of conspecific pollen, number of pollen species, and proportion of heterospecific pollen on stigmas of native plants. We observed visits to selected native species during May and June 2000 and 2001. Stigmas were collected from a subsample of the flowers within these plots, squashed, and the pollen identified and counted under a light microscope. Visitation varied between years and among species of native plants: infestation had mixed effects in 2000 but visitation, especially by halictids was always lower within infestations in 2001. Despite differences in visitation between years, we found significantly less conspecific pollen on stigmas from infested plots in six of eight cases; we never found significantly more conspecific pollen on stigmas from within infestations. Our results emphasize the temporal variability in plant–pollinator relations and the added complexity imposed by an invasive species that will always make prediction of effects difficult. Nonetheless, the consistently lower conspecific pollen counts on native stigmas within infestations, regardless of visitation, suggest the likelihood of negative effects.},

Here we study networks of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities along a 120 000 year soil chronosequence, as they undergo assembly (progression) and then disassembly (retrogression). We found that network assembly and disassembly were symmetrical, self-reinforcing processes that together were capable of generating key attributes of network architecture. Plant and AMF species that had short indirect paths to others in the community (i.e. high centrality), rather than many direct interaction partners (i.e. high degree), were best able to attract new interaction partners and, in the case of AMF species, also to retain existing interactions with plants during retrogression. We then show using simulations that these non-random patterns of attachment and detachment promote nestedness of the network. These results have implications for predicting extinction sequences, identifying focal points for invasions and suggesting trajectories for restoration.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the diversity of flowering plants can enhance pollinator richness and visitation frequency and thereby increase the resilience of pollination. It is assumed that flower traits explain these effects, but it is still unclear which flower traits are responsible, and knowing that, if pollinator richness and visitation frequency are more driven by mass-ratio effects (mean trait values) or by trait diversity. Here, we analyse a three-year data set of pollinator observations collected in a European grassland plant diversity experiment (The Jena experiment). The data entail comprehensive flower trait measurements, including reward traits (nectar and pollen amount), morphological traits (height, symmetry, area, colour spectra) and chemical traits (nectar-amino acid and nectar-sugar concentration). We test if pollinator species richness and visitation frequency of flower communities depend on overall functional diversity combining all flower traits within a community, single trait diversities (within trait variation) and community-weighted means of the single traits, using Bayesian inference. Overall functional diversity did not affect pollinator species richness, but reduced visitation frequency. When looking at individual flower traits separately, we found that single trait diversity of flower reflectance and flower morphology were important predictors of pollinator visitation frequency. Moreover, independent of total flower abundance, community-weighted means of flower height, area, reflectance, nectar-sugar concentration and nectar-amino acid concentration strongly affected both pollinator species richness and visitation frequency. Our results, challenge the idea that functional diversity always positively affects ecosystem functions. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that both single trait diversity and mass-ratio effects of flower traits play an important role for diverse and frequent flower visits, which underlines the functionality of flower traits for pollination services.},

However, the impact of human-induced biodiversity loss on the functioning of plant–pollinator interactions has not been tested experimentally. To understand how plant communities respond to diversity changes in their pollinating fauna, we manipulated the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators under natural conditions. Increasing the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators led to the recruitment of more diverse plant communities. After two years the plant communities pollinated by the most functionally diverse pollinator assemblage contained about 50\% more plant species than did plant communities pollinated by less-diverse pollinator assemblages. Moreover, the positive effect of functional diversity was explained by a complementarity between functional groups of pollinators and plants. Thus, the functional diversity of pollination networks may be critical to ecosystem sustainability.},

The success of a species introduction is conditioned by multiple factors, in particular, ecological interactions. To predict the fate of the introduced population and the community-level outcomes of the introduction, species interaction patterns need to be considered. Here I propose that ecological network models can help in rewilding projects in at least three ways. First, combining ecological information and probabilistic models it is possible to infer the most likely ways whereby the introduced species will integrate the community and which will be its role in the topology of the food web. Second, by determining the species more likely to interact directly or indirectly with the introduced species, it is possible to identify those species that may affect the success of the introduction and those that are more likely to be affected. Third, by constructing potential interaction networks representing the rewilding scenario, one can infer the possible ways by which the overall structure of the network will change and thus devise more efficient plans to monitor the community. Network models can be an important asset in rewilding, helping in feasibility and risk assessment as well as in monitoring the consequences after species release.},

Here, we evaluated the influence of landscape structure over bee community composition and coffee (Coffea arabica) pollination. Our study was undertaken in one of the most important coffee-producing regions of Brazil, and comprised nine landscapes of sun coffee plantations surrounded by different amounts of Atlantic Forest remnants. Using floral exclusion experiments we evaluated fruit set in 15 coffee shrubs per landscape. We also sampled the bees visiting coffee flowers. Our analyses were made at two landscape scales, with 1 and 2km radii, and one shrub scale, with 300m radius around each coffee shrub. We collected 241 bee individuals and identified a total of 22 species. The honeybee Apis mellifera (Apini) was the most abundant flower visitor followed by Trigona spinipes (Meliponini). Native bee abundance, richness and diversity were positively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. Honeybee abundance, on the other hand, was negatively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. The presence of bees resulted in an increase in coffee fruit set of 28\%. A. mellifera abundance positively affected fruit set across spatial scales, while the composition of the native bee community affected fruit set differently at the landscape scales than at the shrub scale. Our work shows that bee pollination services are affected by landscape structure at different spatial scales. These findings can be used in conservation and agricultural planning to maximize crop production while safeguarding biodiversity and the provision of pollination services.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 338–348 Abstract More diverse communities of consumers typically use more resources, which often is attributed to resource partitioning. However, experimentally demonstrating this role of resource partitioning in diverse communities has been difficult. We used an experimental response-surface design, varying intra- and interspecific consumer densities, to compare patterns of resource exploitation between simple and diverse communities of aphid predators. With increasing density, each single consumer species rapidly plateaued in its ability to extract more resources. This suggests intraspecific competition for a subset of the resource pool, a hallmark of resource partitioning. In contrast, more diverse-predator communities achieved greater overall resource depletion. By statistically fitting mechanistic models to the data, we demonstrated that resource partitioning rather than facilitation provides the better explanation for the observed differences in resource use between simple and diverse communities. This model-fitting approach also allowed us to quantify overlap in resource use by different consumer species.},

	abstract = {In modern agricultural landscapes, many organisms providing ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest control are likely constrained by shortage of nectar and/or pollen required for adult nutrition. More and more flower-rich field margin strips and other habitats are created to eliminate these constraints. For most target organisms, however, it is not well known which (types of) flowers are effective in providing suitable pollen and nectar. We studied the suitability of a wide range of flowers as a food source for zoophagous hoverflies (hoverflies with predatory larvae) at five different levels: nectar accessibility (based on flower morphology), realized adult fitness, flower choice (both based on cage experiments), flower visitation and hoverfly abundance in mixed vegetation (both based on field observations). Realized survival of Episyrphus balteatus is related to effective flower depth by a sigmoid function. The critical flower depth is 1·6 mm, which is less than the proboscis size of the hoverfly. For Asteraceae, the critical floret depth is even less than 1·0 mm, which – in contrast to common knowledge – rules out most species within this family. Both flower choice in the laboratory and flower visitation rates in the field are well correlated with nectar accessibility and realized adult survival. In mixed floral vegetation, the number of zoophagous hoverflies is highly correlated with the abundance of only those flowers that have accessible nectar for these hoverflies. Synthesis and applications. This comparative study demonstrates that nectar (and not pollen) accessibility is the main driver determining flower resource suitability, flower choice and abundance of zoophagous hoverflies in arable field margins. The study identifies the limited range of plant species that can effectively support these beneficial insects. Preserving the right flowers in and around agricultural fields could enhance local populations and the pest control and pollination services they provide.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence for declines in wild bees calls for the development and implementation of effective mitigation measures. Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before–after control–impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floral resources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.},

Winter cover crops add diversity to agroecosystems and can benefit soil conservation and health, retention and supply of soil nutrients, regulation of arthropods, and crop yields. Within the framework of a three-year experiment to investigate ecosystem services and disservices associated with 12 winter cover crop treatments during the transition of a small grain - corn - soybean production system to organic management, we examined the effects of cash crop and crop management, cover crop species and diversity, arthropods, and soil properties on Metarhizium spp. in a single field site in central Pennsylvania, USA. We used sentinel insect assays with Galleria mellonella L. to determine the relative occurrence of Metarhizium spp. in soil samples from treatment plots. M. robertsii was the only species detected, and therefore Metarhizium species diversity was not related to cover crop diversity. Detection of M. robertsii was lower in cover crop monocultures and mixtures containing brassicas compared to those with legumes. M. robertsii was detected more frequently in the standing cover crops in the corn phase of the rotation than in the soybean phase, but there was no difference in soil samples in the corn and soybeans after cover crop termination. In samples from cover crops, 33\% of the variation of percentage mortality of sentinel G. mellonella by M. robertsii was explained by positive correlations with cover crop biomass in the previous fall, the biomass of weeds in the current season (spring), soil moisture, Ca, and timing of sampling in days after planting, and by negative correlations with number of days since disturbance prior to soil sampling and percent sand. In samples from corn and soybeans, 23\% of the variation of percentage mortality of sentinel G. mellonella by M. robertsii was explained by positive correlations with soil labile C, electrical conductivity, and activity-density of ground beetles (Carabidae), and by negative correlations with increasing number of days after planting relative to time of sampling, percent sand, and activity-density of mites. The complex interactions of multiple biotic and abiotic factors that shape the soil community requires further research to develop an understanding of how to manage production systems and practices to promote and conserve biological control in the soil.},

	abstract = {Conservation biological control (CBC) is a sustainable approach to pest management that can contribute to a reduction in pesticide use as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy. CBC is based on the premise that countering habitat loss and environmental disturbance associated with intensive crop production will conserve natural enemies, thus contributing to pest suppression. The abundance and diversity of natural enemies increases in response to a variety of conservation measures, including plant and habitat diversification, a reduction in cropping intensity, and increased landscape complexity. However, the response of natural enemy populations to conservation measures is not consistent; often it fails to translate into pest suppression or improved crop yield, and is seldom utilised in commercial crop production settings. CBC is a complex strategy drawing on a number of ecological and behavioural processes, operating at multiple scales, and mediated by management actions that are, potentially, targeted at a wide range of pest organisms. Given this inherent complexity, it is not surprising that the scientific understanding of CBC is incomplete, or that the design and adoption of reliable CBC prescriptions have proved elusive. To tackle this, we consolidate existing knowledge of CBC using a simple conceptual model that organises the functional elements of CBC into a common, unifying framework. We identify and integrate the key biological processes affecting natural enemies and their biological control function across local and regional scales, and consider the interactions, interdependencies and constraints that determine the outcome of CBC strategies. Conservation measures are often effective in supporting natural enemy populations but their success cannot be guaranteed; the greatest limitation to the development of effective CBC is due to a failure to adequately direct biological control services to achieve suppression of the target pests. By considering the performance of these and other components of CBC within the context of an integrated system, we believe that the limiting factors can be identified, and removed, allowing effective CBC strategies to be implemented.},

This article demonstrates a method based on hierarchies that builds on previous efforts to decompose R2 through incremental partitioning. The standard method of incremental partitioning has been to follow one order among the many possible orders available. By taking a hierarchical approach in which all orders of variables are used, the average independent contribution of a variable is obtained and an exact partitioning results. Much the same logic is used to divide the joint effect of a variable. The method is general and applicable to all regression methods, including ordinary least squares, logistic, probit, and log-linear regression. A validation test demonstrates that the algorithm is sensitive to the relationships in the data rather than the proportion of variability accounted for by the statistical model used.},

Workers often want to assert that a given X has a major influence on Y, and so, by using this indirection to infer a probable causal relationship. There are two difficulties apart from the demonstrability issue itself: (1) multiple regression is plagued by collinear relationships in X; and (2) any regression is designed to produce a function that in some way minimizes the overall difference between the observed and ‘predicted’ Ys, which does not necessarily equate to determining probable influence in a multivariate setting. Problem (1) may be explored by comparing two avenues, one in which a single ‘best’ regression model is sought and the other where all possible regression models are considered contemporaneously. It is suggested that if the two approaches do not agree upon which of the independent variables are likely to be ‘significant’, then the deductions must be subject to doubt.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance.

Disentangling network co-structure in multilayer networks is crucial to predict how biodiversity loss may affect the persistence of multispecies assemblages. Existing methods to analyse multilayer networks often fail to consider network co-structure. We present a new method to evaluate the modular co-structure of multilayer networks through the assessment of species degree co-distribution and network module composition. We focus on modular structure because of its high prevalence among ecological networks. We apply our method to two Lepidoptera-plant networks, one describing caterpillar-plant herbivory interactions and one representing adult Lepidoptera nectaring on flowers, thereby possibly pollinating them. More than 50\% of the species established either herbivory or visitation interactions, but not both. These species were over-represented among plants and lepidopterans, and were present in most modules in both networks. Similarity in module composition between networks was high but not different from random expectations. Our method clearly delineates the importance of interpreting multilayer module composition similarity in the light of the constraints imposed by network structure to predict the potential indirect effects of species loss through interconnected modular networks.},

	abstract = {Summary
Nearly ten years ago, there was a call for synthesis in the debate on the relative contributions of top-down and bottom-up forces to the population and community ecology of terrestrial herbivores. Although numerous published studies have explored the issue during the last decade, little consensus or synthesis has emerged. Two principle reasons for a lack of synthesis are the fuzzy use of terminology and the inherent weaknesses of methods used to analyze herbivore populations and communities. Using the population dynamics of insects on plants as a focus, the purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, graphical models and terminology are offered that clarify the responses of insect herbivores to top-down and bottom-up forces. The approach distinguishes among effects upon1) regulation, 2) equilibrium, 3) temporal variance, and 4) spatial variance. It is suggested that similar approaches should be used at the community and ecosystem levels. Second, the uses and abuses of time series analysis, life table analysis, and experimental manipulation are considered in some detail. No single approach can provide an adequate description of top-down and bottom-up forces that influence terrestrial herbivores. In combination, however, the weaknesses of one approach may be balanced by the strengths of another. Finally, some possible avenues for future research are suggested that may lead us toward synthesis. Vor fast 10 Jahren gab es in der Debatte um die relativen Beiträge der “top-down”- und “bottom-up”-Wirkungen in der Populationsökologie und der Ökologie der Lebensgemeinschaften terrestrischer Herbivorer die Forderung nach einer Synthese. Auch wenn zahlreiche Veröffentlichungen diesen Punkt während des letzten Jahrzehnts untersuchten ist wenig Übereinstimmung oder eine Synthese daraus hervorgegangen. Zwei prinzipielle Gründe für das Fehlen einer Synthese sind der ungenaue Gebrauch der Terminologie und inhärente Schwächen der Methoden, die zur Analyse von herbivoren Populationen oder Lebensgemeinschaften verwendet werden. Die Veröffentlichung konzentriert sich auf die Populationsdynamik von Insekten auf Pflanzen und verfolgt dabei drei Absichten: Zuerst werden graphische Modelle und Fachbegriffe angeboten, die die Reaktion von Herbivoren auf “top-down”- und “bottom-up”-Wirkungen klären. Der Ansatz unterscheidet dabei zwischen Auswirkungen auf (1) die Regulation, (2) das Gleichgewicht, (3) die zeitliche Varianz und (4) die räumliche Varianz. Es wird vorgeschlagen, die gleichen Ansätze auf der Lebensgemeinschafts- und der Ökosystemebene zu verwenden. Zweitens werden der Ge- und Missbrauch von Zeitreihen- und Lebenstafel-Analysen sowie experimentelle Manipulationen detailliert betrachtet. Eine angemessene Beschreibung der “top-down”- und “bottom-up”-Wirkungen auf terrestrische Herbivore kann von keinem Ansatz allein geleistet werden. In Kombination können jedoch die Schwächen des einen durch die Stärken des anderen Ansatzes ausgeglichen werden. Zuletzt werden einige mögliche Richtungen für zukünftige Forschung empfohlen, die zu einer Synthese führen können.},

	abstract = {Increasing levels of eutrophication in coastal waters and recognition of natural variation in supply of nutrients, through for example variations in upwelling intensity, have led to an increasing demand to understand the role of bottom up forcing in coastal communities. Rocky intertidal habitats are highly disturbed and are composed of a patchy mosaic of assemblages in different successional stages. The role of consumer control of algae in such habitats is well recognised but the way consumer control interacts with variation in resource supply is still debated. We examined, using a factorial manipulative experiment, the way top down control by molluscan grazers interacts with nutrient supply to determine the community composition and productivity of early successional communities in intertidal rockpools. The experiment was run over a six-month period, through the summer months, when nutrients were potentially limiting. Rockpools were cleared of biota and nutrient supply enhanced using slow release fertiliser, while the level of molluscan grazing was reduced through regular removals. Macroalgal colonisation was rapid. Positive effects of nutrient enrichment on macroalgal cover were generally lower than the negative effects of grazer control, although at the peak of algal cover, nutrient effects were apparent irrespective of grazer treatment. There were distinct differences in the identity of dominant species among nutrient treatments with green Ulva spp. dominating under enhanced nutrient conditions and red Ceramium spp. dominating under ambient conditions. These differences contributed to a mismatch between effect estimates based on cover and those based on direct measures of productivity. The use of percentage cover as a surrogate of biomass in intertidal studies is discussed. The results indicate that in a disturbed environment enhanced nutrient supply can stimulate macroalgal blooms despite strong top down control by intertidal grazers.},

	abstract = {The relative importance of resources (bottom-up forces) and natural enemies (top-down forces) for regulating food web dynamics has been debated, and both forces have been found to be critical for determining food web structure. How the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces varies between sites with different abiotic conditions is not well understood. Using the pitcher plant inquiline community as a model system, I examine how the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects differs between two disparate sites. Resources (ant carcasses) and top predators (mosquito larvae) were manipulated in two identical 4 × 4 factorial press experiments, conducted at two geographically distant sites (Michigan and Florida) within the range of the purple pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, and the aquatic community that resides in its leaves. Overall, top predators reduced the density of prey populations while additional resources bolstered them, and the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces varied between sites and for different trophic levels. Specifically, top-down effects on protozoa were stronger in Florida than in Michigan, while the opposite pattern was found for rotifers. These findings experimentally demonstrate that the strength of predator–prey interactions, even those involving the same species, vary across space. While only two sites are compared in this study, I hypothesize that site differences in temperature, which influences metabolic rate, may be responsible for variation in consumer–resource interactions. These findings warrant further investigation into the specific factors that modify the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects.},

	abstract = {1. Arthropod communities are structured by complex interactions between bottom-up (resource-based) and top-down (natural enemy-based) forces. Their relative importance in shaping arthropod communities, however, continues to be under debate. Bottom-up and top-down forces can be affected by intraspecific plant variation, for example by differences in concentrations of secondary metabolites that affect herbivore abundance through plant quality (bottom-up) or attract natural enemies of these herbivores (top-down). 2. Our objective was to investigate whether herbivore abundance is more strongly affected by plant-mediated bottom-up or top-down forces. 3. We used a model system of four cultivars of Brassica oleracea that show a high degree of variation in several plant traits, resistance to herbivores and attraction of natural enemies. During two field seasons, we recorded the abundance of several herbivorous and carnivorous insect species. To assess the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down forces, we quantified chemical and morphological traits of the cultivars (bottom-up) and assessed parasitization of herbivores and predator oviposition on plants inoculated with a controlled number of herbivores (top-down). 4. We show that intraspecific variation in plant chemistry and morphology consistently affects the abundance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies, resulting in cascading effects on tritrophic interactions in the associated insect community. Foliar profiles of glucosinolates and leaf toughness appeared most important for these effects. Brassica oleracea cultivars that harboured the largest numbers of herbivores also harboured the largest numbers of natural enemies. Differences in the fraction of herbivores parasitized and in predator oviposition on plants inoculated with a controlled number of herbivores could not explain the differences in natural abundance of herbivores. 5. Although abundance of herbivores is most likely influenced by a combination of bottom-up and top-down forces, it appears that in the tritrophic system investigated, bottom-up forces (plant chemistry and morphology) were more important for herbivore abundance than plant-mediated top-down forces (attraction and arrestment of natural enemies).},

	abstract = {The abundance of primary producers is controlled by bottom-up and top-down forces. Despite the fact that there is consensus that the abundance of freshwater macrophytes is strongly influenced by the availability of resources for plant growth, the importance of top-down control by vertebrate consumers is debated, because field studies yield contrasting results. We hypothesized that these bottom-up and top-down forces may interact, and that consumer impact on macrophyte abundance depends on the nutrient status of the water body. To test this hypothesis, experimental ponds with submerged vegetation containing a mixture of species were subjected to a fertilization treatment and we introduced consumers (mallard ducks, for 8 days) on half of the ponds in a full factorial design. Over the whole 66-day experiment fertilized ponds became dominated by Elodea nuttallii and ponds without extra nutrients by Chara globularis. Nutrient addition significantly increased plant N and P concentrations. There was a strong interactive effect of duck presence and pond nutrient status: macrophyte biomass was reduced (by 50 \%) after the presence of the ducks on fertilized ponds, but not in the unfertilized ponds. We conclude that nutrient availability interacts with top-down control of submerged vegetation. This may be explained by higher plant palatability at higher nutrient levels, either by a higher plant nutrient concentration or by a shift towards dominance of more palatable plant species, resulting in higher consumer pressure. Including nutrient availability may offer a framework to explain part of the contrasting field observations of consumer control of macrophyte abundance.},

	abstract = {Polarized debates about top-down vs. bottom-up control have given way to more nuanced understanding of control by both resources and consumers in many systems, but coral reef sponges have recently been asserted to differ from other groups in being controlled exclusively top-down. This assertion has been countered by reports of exclusively bottom-up control, with both conclusions based on studies of the same species. Accelerating deterioration of coral reefs motivates knowing the contexts in which either consumers or nutrients or both control key ecosystem role players like sponges. Accordingly, genotype- and size-controlled individuals of 12 common Caribbean reef sponge species were transplanted, in the field, into five circumstances differing in predators, competitors, and the picoplankton consumed by sponges. Growth and survival of the experimental transplants for periods of 1–9 yr revealed context-dependent control of sponges. Primary control of growth was bottom-up, with more picoplankton resulting in consistent and sustained higher growth rates for all 12 of these ecologically and phylogenetically diverse species. Top-down control was not detected within-habitat, on the coral reef. However, between-habitat control was by predation and competition, with reef sponges excluded from adjacent seagrass meadows by spongivorous starfish, and excluded from mangrove prop roots by faster-growing mangrove sponges. These results highlight the strong importance of experimental design details that consider behavior idiosyncrasies, sufficiently long time scales, and appropriate division of species into categories. Diametrically opposite results from studies of the same species also illustrate the inherently greater difficulty of detecting bottom-up processes and the importance of distinguishing within-habitat vs. between-habitat patterns and processes.},

Here, we determine how the specialization of mutualistic interactions varies with respect to the geographic range size of plants and pollinators and assess how they respond to the introduction of the alien honeybee. We also compare network characteristics (connectance, specialization and nestedness) between an invaded low mountain and non-invaded high mountain network. Location St Katherine Protectorate, South Sinai, Egypt. Methods We quantified bee–plant interactions in 42 plots between April and July 2013 and created visitation networks for the low mountains (beehives present) and the high mountains (beehives absent). We then compared visitation network metrics between range-restricted, regionally distributed and widespread plants and pollinators and assessed topological differences between the low and high mountain networks. Results Range-restricted bees were involved in a significantly higher number of total interactions than regional and widespread native bees, but showed no evidence of increased generalization. In contrast, range-restricted plants were involved in fewer interactions and exhibited significantly higher specialization and a high dependency on range-restricted pollinators. The introduced honeybee acted as a super-generalist and was associated with an increase in network-level generalization and nestedness. Honeybees exhibited high levels of resource overlap with range-restricted bees and made few visits to range-restricted plant species. Main conclusions Range-restricted plants are more specialized in their interactions than range-restricted pollinators, suggesting that the forces shaping the structure of interaction network can vary between partners. Alien honeybees made few visits to range-restricted plants, but exhibited disproportionately high levels of floral competition with range-restricted bees. If high levels of competition lead to population declines then specialized range-restricted plants will be at higher risk of pollen deficits than more widespread species.},

	abstract = {Biological intimacy—the degree of physical proximity or integration of partner taxa during their life cycles—is thought to promote the evolution of reciprocal specialization and modularity in the networks formed by co-occurring mutualistic species, but this hypothesis has rarely been tested. Here, we test this “biological intimacy hypothesis” by comparing the network architecture of brood pollination mutualisms, in which specialized insects are simultaneously parasites (as larvae) and pollinators (as adults) of their host plants to that of other mutualisms which vary in their biological intimacy (including ant-myrmecophyte, ant-extrafloral nectary, plant-pollinator and plant-seed disperser assemblages). We use a novel dataset sampled from leafflower trees (Phyllanthaceae: Phyllanthus s. l. [Glochidion]) and their pollinating leafflower moths (Lepidoptera: Epicephala) on three oceanic islands (French Polynesia) and compare it to equivalent published data from congeners on continental islands (Japan). We infer taxonomic diversity of leafflower moths using multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis and examine several network structural properties: modularity (compartmentalization), reciprocality (symmetry) of specialization and algebraic connectivity. We find that most leafflower-moth networks are reciprocally specialized and modular, as hypothesized. However, we also find that two oceanic island networks differ in their modularity and reciprocal specialization from the others, as a result of a supergeneralist moth taxon which interacts with nine of 10 available hosts. Our results generally support the biological intimacy hypothesis, finding that leafflower-moth networks (usually) share a reciprocally specialized and modular structure with other intimate mutualisms such as ant-myrmecophyte symbioses, but unlike nonintimate mutualisms such as seed dispersal and nonintimate pollination. Additionally, we show that generalists—common in nonintimate mutualisms—can also evolve in intimate mutualisms, and that their effect is similar in both types of assemblages: once generalists emerge they reshape the network organization by connecting otherwise isolated modules.},

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

	abstract = {Most multicellular species alive are tropical arthropods associated with plants. Hence, the host-specificity of these species, and their diversity at different scales, are keys to understanding the assembly structure of global biodiversity. We present a comprehensive scheme in which tropical herbivore megadiversity can be partitioned into the following components: (A) more host plant species per se, (B) more arthropod species per plant species, (C) higher host specificity of herbivores, or (D) higher species turnover (beta diversity) in the tropics than in the temperate zone. We scrutinize recent studies addressing each component and identify methodological differences among them. We find substantial support for the importance of component A, more tropical host species. A meta-analysis of published results reveals intermediate to high correlations between plant and herbivore diversity, accounting for up to 60\% of the variation in insect species richness. Support for other factors is mixed, with studies too scarce and approaches too uneven to allow for quantitative summaries. More research on individual components is unlikely to resolve their relative contribution to overall herbivore diversity. Instead, we call for the adoption of more coherent methods that avoid pitfalls for larger-scale comparisons, for studies assessing different components together rather than singly, and for studies that investigate herbivore beta-diversity (component D) in a more comprehensive perspective.},

	abstract = {Host plant secondary chemistry can have cascading impacts on host and range expansion of herbivorous insect populations. We investigated the role of host secondary compounds on pheromone production by the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) (MPB) and beetle attraction in response to a historical (lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and a novel (jack pine, Pinus banksiana) hosts, as pheromones regulate the host colonization process. Beetles emit the same pheromones from both hosts, but more trans-verbenol, the primary aggregation pheromone, was emitted by female beetles on the novel host. The phloem of the novel host contains more α-pinene, a secondary compound that is the precursor for trans-verbenol production in beetle, than the historical host. Beetle-induced emission of 3-carene, another secondary compound found in both hosts, was also higher from the novel host. Field tests showed that the addition of 3-carene to the pheromone mixture mimicking the aggregation pheromones produced from the two host species increased beetle capture. We conclude that chemical similarity between historical and novel hosts has facilitated host expansion of MPB in jack pine forests through the exploitation of common host secondary compounds for pheromone production and aggregation on the hosts. Furthermore, broods emerging from the novel host were larger in terms of body size.},

	abstract = {Host shifts by herbivorous insects have contributed substantially to current patterns of association between insects and plants. Despite their evolutionary and agricultural interest, however, the plant traits that predispose insects to colonize some plants instead of others are poorly understood. To examine whether ancestral and novel hosts share similar chemical oviposition stimulants that would facilitate a host shift, we investigated a well-substantiated host shift within the Papilio machaon group of swallowtail butterflies. Papilio machaon aliaska uses three plant species as host plants. Cnidium cnidiifolium belongs to the family Apiaceae, the ancestral host-plant family of the P. machaon group. Artemisia arctica and Petasites frigidus, by contrast, belong to the family Asteraceae and were colonized relatively recently by this group of butterflies. Papilio machaon oregonius, a close relative of P. m. aliaska, feeds and oviposits exclusively on Artemisia dracunculus, also in the Asteraceae. We made polar and nonpolar extracts of all four host plants, conducted bioassays with P. m. aliaska and P. m. oregonius females to test for oviposition stimulants, and found that the polar extracts were the most active. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, we separated the polar extracts into three fractions and again conducted bioassays with P. m. aliaska and P. m. oregonius females. The fraction containing hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives was the only active fraction for all plant species. We further separated the HCA fraction and found two sub-fractions that were active in all of the host-plant species. Co-chromatography indicated that several major constituents of the active fractions are shared between ancestral and novel hosts. In a secondary series of experiments, we investigated chemical fractions of a non-host plant, Artemisia frigida, and identified fractions of the A. frigida extract that contained oviposition deterrents and a fraction that contained oviposition stimulants for P. m. aliaska females. We conclude that the similarity of stimulant profiles in ancestral and novel host plants is consistent with the hypothesis that plant chemistry has played a role in the establishment of this host shift.},

Although we find few consistencies in plant induction by specialists versus generalists, feeding guilds are predictive of differential plant responses.

However, if natural enemies follow herbivores to their novel host plants, enemy-free space may only be temporary. We tested this by studying the colonisation of the introduced tree Eucalyptus grandis (Hill) Maiden (Myrtaceae) by insects in Brazil, where various species of herbivores have added eucalyptus to their host plant range, which consists of native myrtaceous species such as guava. Some herbivores, for example, Thyrinteina leucoceraea Ringe (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), cause outbreaks in eucalyptus plantations but not on guava, possibly because eucalyptus offers enemy-free space. We sampled herbivores (mainly Lepidoptera species) and natural enemies on eucalyptus and guava and assessed parasitism of Lepidoptera larvae on both host plant species during ca. 2years. Overall, predators were encountered more frequently on guava than on eucalyptus. In contrast, parasitoids were encountered equally and parasitism rates of Lepidoptera larvae were similar on both host plants. This indicates that herbivores may escape some enemies by moving to a novel host plant. However, this escape may be temporary and may vary with time. We argue that studying temporal and spatial patterns of enemy-free space and the response of natural enemies to host use changes of their herbivorous prey is essential for understanding the role of natural enemies in the evolution of host plant use by herbivorous arthropods.},

	abstract = {Investigations of host plant selection in herbivorous arthropods have emphasized the importance of oviposition site selection by adults; however, a more complete picture of this process requires additional consideration of the factors influencing host plant choice during the immature feeding stages. We conducted a series of larval choice experiments to examine both the innate and induced preferences of larvae of the Silver-spotted skipper (Epargyreus clarus L.) on three commonly used hosts (Wisteria, Robinia, and Pueraria). Late instar E. clarus larvae reared on each of the three host plants displayed an overall pattern of innate preferences that correlated well with larval performance measures and reflected differences in foliar nutrient concentrations. Larval preferences were also influenced by rearing host species, indicating a role for feeding-induced preferences. When larvae reared on low-quality Wisteria for the first four instars were switched to higher quality Pueraria for the final instar, they developed more quickly and attained significantly higher pupal mass than larvae maintained on Wisteria throughout development. Similarly, larvae switched from Pueraria to Wisteria for the final instar suffered increased development time and produced significantly smaller pupae than those maintained on Pueraria throughout. Thus host-switching, particularly during the more mobile final instars, appears to offer larvae an opportunity to recoup fitness losses associated with early development on a low-quality host. For an equal amount of consumption, larvae feeding on Pueraria gained 50\% more mass than those feeding on Wisteria, reflecting measured differences in foliar nitrogen concentration; despite these overall differences in quality, larval growth efficiency was similar among hosts. Especially in the age of common exotic plant introductions, a full understanding of the behavioral component of host selection by herbivorous insects requires appreciation of the dynamic role that immatures can play in host selection and use.},

Behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits commonly vary among insect populations associated with different plants, but how host shifts cause trait divergence is often unclear. We investigated whether experimental host shifts would modify a key insect trait, egg-laying behavior, in a seed beetle. Beetle populations associated long-term with either a small-seeded host (mung bean) or a large-seeded host (cowpea) were switched to each other’s host. After 36–55 generations, we assayed three aspects of oviposition behavior known to differ between the mung bean- and cowpea-adapted populations. Responses to the host shifts were asymmetrical. Females from lines transferred from mung bean to cowpea produced less uniform distributions of eggs among seeds, were more likely to add an egg to an occupied seed, and were more likely to “dump” eggs when seeds were absent. These lines thus converged toward the cowpea-adapted population. In contrast, the reciprocal host shift had no effect; oviposition behavior was unchanged in lines transferred from cowpea to mung bean. We suggest that these results reflect an asymmetry in the fitness consequences of each host shift, which in turn depended on differences in larval competitiveness in the original populations. Interactions among multiple fitness components are likely to make evolutionary responses less predictable in novel environments.},

	abstract = {A consequence of plant diversity is that it can allow or force herbivores to consume multiple plant species, which studies indicate can have major effects on herbivore fitness. An underappreciated but potentially important factor modulating the consequences of multi-species diets is the extent to which herbivores can choose their diets versus being forced to consume specific host-plant sequences. We examined how host-selection behavior alters the effects of multi-species diets using the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and diets of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum), tomato plants (S. lycopersicum), or both. When we gave beetles simultaneous access to both plants, allowing them to choose their diets, their final mass was within 0.1\% of the average mass across both monocultures and 43.6\% lower than mass on potato, the superior host in monoculture. This result indicates these beetles do not benefit from a mixed diet, and that the presence of tomato, an inferior but suitable host, makes it difficult to use potato. In contrast, when we forced beetles to switch between host species, their final mass was 37.8\% less than the average of beetles fed constant diets of either host species and within 3.5\% of the mass on tomato even though they also fed on potato. This indicates preventing host-selection behavior magnified the negative effects of this multi-species diet. Our results imply that ecological contexts that constrain host-selection or force host-switches, such as communities with competition or predation, will lead plant species diversity to reduce the performance of insect herbivores.},

Species-specific food plant choice and niche breadths are presented for each of these species.

Phylogenetic constraints are evident such that gomphocerinae are primarily grass feeders while melanoplinae feed predominantly on forbs; the oedipodinae show less clearcut tendencies.Feeding patterns are remarkably constant from site to site and overall, community niche breadth distributions between sites do not differ greatly. Individual species tend to eat the same plant species at various sites and maintain similar niche breadths. Species with relatively specialized diets tend to feed on predictable plant species such as grasses and long-lived perrenial forbs.Grasshopper feeding patterns present some problems to the current theory of herbivore diet specialization since forb feeding melanoplines tend to be polyphagous (contrary to predictions). Life history patterns unrelated to tracking host plants may explain some aspects of diet breadth since diet selectivities are presumably adjusted according to the probability of finding suitable food plants.},

Food availability estimates, taken by a weight-estimate method, facilitated the determination of food preferences. Two cases of high overlap in diets and period of habitat occupancy occurred between species which consumed equal or almost equal numbers of different foods (foodniche breadth) and had almost identical foraging behavior. The first case occurred early in the season between Xanthippus corallipes and Arphia conspersa with foodniche breadths of 14 and 11, respectively. The second case occurred later in the season between Amphitornus coloradus and Trachyrhachys kiowa both of which have foodniche breadths of 6. The amount of movement between plants while feeding was equal or almost equal in both cases, thus we observed high dietary overlap between species with equal ecological efficiencies. Dietary overlap between the 14 grasshopper species decreased as foodniche dimensions increased and the grasshopper population as a whole utilized each food resource approximately proportional to its relative abundance. Factors influencing the interpretation and importance of dietary overlap in this study included 1. non-synchronous life cycles, 2. seasonal changes in diets and food preferences, 3. complexity of the food resources, 4. variations in foodniche dimensions among grasshopper species, and 5. variations in diets between males and females within a species. Our findings agree with MacArthur and Levins theory that the number of competing species which can coexist is proportional to the total range of the environment divided by the niche breadth of the species.},

In all cases, insects were provided with one of three different host plants, or a mixture of all three. For most species, several different experiments were performed. Survivorship, gain in mass, and fecundity were used as measures of performance. In no case was there evidence that mixtures were better than single foods.

The majority of component species are specialists and a large proportion is parasitic as herbivores and carnivores, with consequences for high sensitivity to heterogeneity on a variety of scales. Relatively large primary producers support relatively small insect herbivores and carnivores, with plants providing both food and habitat, making resource-driven effects very strong. Complexity of resources provided by plants, with influences up the food web, is generated by at least seven major factors: (i) plants as food; (ii) plants as habitat; (iii) the physical traits of plants such as size, toughness and trichomes; (iv) traits of plants that require evolutionary responses by herbivores in terms of crypsis, phenological synchrony, life history and behavioral adaptations; (v) the constitutive chemicals in plants; (vi) the induced changes in plants caused by herbivory; and (vii) landscape and biogeographic variation in vegetation types and food web richness. No other trophic level has such a wide-ranging impact on other trophic levels. But such broad impact makes the term ‘food web’ overly narrow and inadequate. The term ‘interaction web’ is preferable, aiding recognition of the many kinds of interactions that pass up food webs from living plants. Any claim that top-down impact is stronger than bottom-up influences is necessarily couched in a narrow sense of biomass or numbers reduction.},

	abstract = {A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

Taking the mean of most of these new estimates indicates that globally there are approximately 1.5 million, 5.5 million, and 7 million species of beetles, insects, and terrestrial arthropods, respectively. Previous estimates of 30 million species or more based on the host specificity of insects to plants now seem extremely unlikely. With 1 million insect species named, this suggests that 80\% remain to be discovered and that a greater focus should be placed on less-studied taxa such as many families of Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera and on poorly sampled parts of the world. DNA tools have revealed many new species in taxonomically intractable groups, but unbiased studies of previously well-researched insect faunas indicate that 1–2\% of species may be truly cryptic.},

Pollination, especially by insects, is a key element in ecosystem functioning, and hence constitutes an ecosystem service of global importance. Not only sexual reproduction of plants is ensured, but also yields are stabilized and genetic variability of crops is maintained, counteracting inbreeding depression and facilitating system resilience. While experiencing rapid environmental change, there is an increased demand for food and income security, especially in sub-Saharan communities, which are highly dependent on small scale agriculture. By combining exclusion experiments, pollinator surveys and field manipulations, this study for the first time quantifies the contribution of bee pollinators to smallholders’ production of the major cash crops, cotton and sesame, in Burkina Faso. Pollination by honeybees and wild bees significantly increased yield quantity and quality on average up to 62\%, while exclusion of pollinators caused an average yield gap of 37\% in cotton and 59\% in sesame. Self-pollination revealed inbreeding depression effects on fruit set and low germination rates in the F1-generation. Our results highlight potential negative consequences of any pollinator decline, provoking risks to agriculture and compromising crop yields in sub-Saharan West Africa.},

	abstract = {Dispersal of seeds away from the parent plant may facilitate escape from density-dependent seed mortality. However, many post-dispersal events can have a profound influence on the survival of dispersed seeds. By incorporating seeds in the dung that dung beetles process for consumption and oviposition, dung beetles could enhance seed survival if they remove seeds from areas of high predation risk and place them in locations that avoid subsequent predation and that are suitable for germination. The role of dung beetles in seed survival was investigated over 15 mo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Depths of seeds buried by beetles, levels of predation on buried and unburied seeds, and germination success of seeds buried to different depths were examined. Results suggest that by burying seeds dung beetles increase the probability that seeds will escape predation and germinate. Of seeds placed in dungpiles, 69\% remained at the surface, while 25\% were buried from 1-3 cm in depth. Larger seeds were buried more shallowly than smaller seeds. Buried seeds were less likely to be removed by predators than seeds at the surface. Germination of seeds buried at 1- and 3-cm depths was significantly higher than seeds buried at 10 cm. For the species tested, many seeds were buried by dung beetles between 1 and 3 cm and at this depth there was a high probability of escaping predators and germinating. This demonstrates the potential ecological importance of dung beetles in facilitating seed survival and provides data to consider the role of dung beetles in the evolution of seed attributes.},

	abstract = {Literature data were collected on the floristic distribution and toxicity of phytochemicals to herbivores and on herbivore specialization in order to test phytochemical coevolution theory. The theory makes four predictions that can be tested with this information. Herbivores can adapt to novel, more toxic chemicals by becoming specialists, or they can become generalists but at the cost of lower feeding success on any particular host. Thus, the first two predictions are as follows: herbivores should do better on chemicals that are present in their normal host, and this pattern should be stronger for specialists than for generalists. The “escape and radiation” aspect of the theory holds that if a plant taxon with a novel defense chemical diversifies, the chemical will become widespread. Eventually, herbivores will adapt to and disarm it. So the third prediction is that more widespread chemicals are less toxic than more narrowly distributed ones. Because generalists should not do as well as specialists on chemicals disarmed by the latter, the fourth prediction is that the third prediction should be more true for generalists than specialists and should depend on presence/absence of the chemical in the normal host. Multiple regressions of toxicity (herbivore mortality and final weight) on three predictor variables (chemical presence/absence in the normal host, specialism, and chemical floristic distribution) and relevant interactions were used to test these predictions. Chemical presence/absence in the normal host, the interaction between this variable and specialism, and chemical floristic distribution had significant effects on both measures of toxicity, supporting the first three predictions of the model. Support for the fourth prediction (a three‐way interaction among all predictor variables) was evident for final weight but not mortality, perhaps because growth is more responsive to toxicity differences than survival. In short, the phytochemistry literature provides broad support for the phytochemical coevolution model.},

As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of “gray areas” between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

We assessed the implications of tree species selection in the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest regarding carbon stocking and species conservation. This assessment was based on a comprehensive dataset of seedling acquisition records from 961 restoration projects, more than14 million seedlings, 192 forest remnants, and functional data from 1,223 tree species. We found that animal-dispersed trees with larger seeds tend to have higher seed prices, yet are underrepresented in the seedlings acquired for restoration plantations. Compared to forest remnants, fruit supply potentially offered by the species acquired for restoration plantings is lower for birds, but higher for bats. Reduced abundance of medium- and/or large-seeded, animal-dispersed trees lead to declines of 2.8–10.6\% in simulated potential carbon stocking. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, policy interventions may be needed to encourage greater representation of large-seeded, animal-dispersed tree species in Atlantic Forest restorations. These findings provide critical guidance for recovering tree functional diversity, plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions, and carbon stocking in multi-species tropical forest restoration plantings.},

Interdisciplinary paleoecological, archaeological, and historical studies challenge this view, indicating that land use has been extensive and sustained for millennia in some regions and that recent trends may represent as much a recovery as an acceleration. Here we synthesize recent scientific evidence and theory on the emergence, history, and future of land use as a process transforming the Earth System and use this to explain why relatively small human populations likely caused widespread and profound ecological changes more than 3,000 y ago, whereas the largest and wealthiest human populations in history are using less arable land per person every decade. Contrasting two spatially explicit global reconstructions of land-use history shows that reconstructions incorporating adaptive changes in land-use systems over time, including land-use intensification, offer a more spatially detailed and plausible assessment of our planet's history, with a biosphere and perhaps even climate long ago affected by humans. Although land-use processes are now shifting rapidly from historical patterns in both type and scale, integrative global land-use models that incorporate dynamic adaptations in human–environment relationships help to advance our understanding of both past and future land-use changes, including their sustainability and potential global effects.},

Ascertaining plant–herbivore interaction structure at the ecological community level is important for predicting responses of herbivores to plant species loss. We sampled arthropods and plants across three years, beginning in the fourth year of an experimental prairie restoration containing three treatment levels of sown plant diversity. Plots initially planted with higher plant diversity had higher arthropod species richness. Sown diversity treatments strongly affected plant–herbivore interaction structure: The increased sown diversity treatment decreased plant–herbivore connectance, increased average herbivore diet generalism, and increased herbivore robustness to plant species loss. Treatments diverged over time with the last year of sampling showing the greatest difference between treatments in plant and arthropod species richness, and plant–herbivore network structural properties. Network structural properties of the high sown diversity treatment were the least variable temporally. However, divergence of plant and arthropod between diversity treatments was not found in traditional ordinations of community taxonomic composition. While previous comparisons of plant–herbivore interaction networks across ecological gradients treated network size (biodiversity) as a confounding factor, we demonstrate that plant diversity can directly shape network structure, and higher plant diversity maintains less temporally variable ecological networks of herbivores and their host plants.},

Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.},

To assess such changes in resilience, we analyse trends in the frequency of species in Great Britain that provide key ecosystem functions—specifically decomposition, carbon sequestration, pollination, pest control and cultural values. For 4,424 species over four decades, there have been significant net declines among animal species that provide pollination, pest control and cultural values. Groups providing decomposition and carbon sequestration remain relatively stable, as fewer species are in decline and these are offset by large numbers of new arrivals into Great Britain. While there is general concern about degradation of a wide range of ecosystem functions, our results suggest actions should focus on particular functions for which there is evidence of substantial erosion of their resilience.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem stability and the maintenance of optimal ecosystem functionality. Conservation measures are thus essential to safeguard the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides and human society needs. Current anthropogenic threats may lead to detrimental (and perhaps irreversible) ecosystem degradation, providing strong motivation to evaluate the response of ecological communities to various anthropogenic pressures. In particular, ecosystem functions that sustain key ecosystem services should be identified and prioritized for conservation action. Traditional diversity measures (e.g. ‘species richness’) may not adequately capture the aspects of biodiversity most relevant to ecosystem stability and functionality, but several new concepts may be more appropriate. These include ‘response diversity’, describing the variation of responses to environmental change among species of a particular community. Response diversity may also be a key determinant of ecosystem resilience in the face of anthropogenic pressures and environmental uncertainty. However, current understanding of response diversity is poor, and we see an urgent need to disentangle the conceptual strands that pervade studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our review clarifies the links between response diversity and the maintenance of ecosystem functionality by focusing on the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity and the concept of functional redundancy. We provide a conceptual model to describe how loss of response diversity may cause ecosystem degradation through decreased ecosystem resilience. We explicitly explain how response diversity contributes to functional compensation and to spatio-temporal complementarity among species, leading to long-term maintenance of ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent quantitative studies suggest that traditional diversity measures may often be uncoupled from measures (such as response diversity) that may be more effective proxies for ecosystem stability and resilience. Certain conclusions and recommendations of earlier studies using these traditional measures as indicators of ecosystem resilience thus may be suspect. We believe that functional ecology perspectives incorporating the effects and responses of diversity are essential for development of management strategies to safeguard (and restore) optimal ecosystem functionality (especially multifunctionality). Our review highlights these issues and we envision our work generating debate around the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functionality, and leading to improved conservation priorities and biodiversity management practices that maximize ecosystem resilience in the face of uncertain environmental change.},

	abstract = {Conservation outcomes are principally achieved through the protection of intact habitat or the restoration of degraded habitat. Restoration is generally considered a lower priority action than protection because protection is thought to provide superior outcomes, at lower costs, without the time delay required for restoration. Yet while it is broadly accepted that protected intact habitat safeguards more biodiversity and generates greater ecosystem services per unit area than restored habitat, conservation lacks a theory that can coherently compare the relative outcomes of the two actions. We use a dynamic landscape model to integrate these two actions into a unified conservation theory of protection and restoration. Using nonlinear benefit functions, we show that both actions are crucial components of a conservation strategy that seeks to optimise either biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services provision. In contrast to conservation orthodoxy, in some circumstances, restoration should be strongly preferred to protection. The relative priority of protection and restoration depends on their costs and also on the different time lags that are inherent to both protection and restoration. We derive a simple and easy-to-interpret heuristic that integrates these factors into a single equation that applies equally to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service objectives. We use two examples to illustrate the theory: bird conservation in tropical rainforests and coastal defence provided by mangrove forests.},

The majority of relationships between attributes and ecosystem services cited in the 530 studies were positive. For example, the services of water quality regulation, water flow regulation, mass flow regulation and landscape aesthetics were improved by increases in community and habitat area. Functional traits, such as richness and diversity, also displayed a predominantly positive relationship across the services, most commonly discussed for atmospheric regulation, pest regulation and pollination. A number of studies also discussed a positive correlation with stand age, particularly for atmospheric regulation. Species level traits were found to benefit a number of ecosystem services, with species abundance being particularly important for pest regulation, pollination and recreation, and species richness for timber production and freshwater fishing. Instances of biodiversity negatively affecting the examined ecosystem services were few in number for all ecosystem services, except freshwater provision. The review showed that ecosystem services are generated from numerous interactions occurring in complex systems. However, improving understanding of at least some of the key relationships between biodiversity and service provision will help guide effective management and protection strategies.},

	abstract = {While climate change and associated increases in sea surface temperature and ocean acidification, are among the most important global stressors to coral reefs, overfishing and nutrient pollution are among the most significant local threats. Here we examined the independent and interactive effects of reduced grazing pressure and nutrient enrichment using settlement tiles on a coral-dominated reef via long-term manipulative experimentation. We found that unique assemblages developed in each treatment combination confirming that both nutrients and herbivores are important drivers of reef community structure. When herbivores were removed, fleshy algae dominated, while crustose coralline algae (CCA) and coral were more abundant when herbivores were present. The effects of fertilization varied depending on herbivore treatment; without herbivores fleshy algae increased in abundance and with herbivores, CCA increased. Coral recruits only persisted in treatments exposed to grazers. Herbivore removal resulted in rapid changes in community structure while there was a lag in response to fertilization. Lastly, re-exposure of communities to natural herbivore populations caused reversals in benthic community trajectories but the effects of fertilization remained for at least 2 months. These results suggest that increasing herbivore populations on degraded reefs may be an effective strategy for restoring ecosystem structure and function and in reversing coral–algal phase-shifts but that this strategy may be most effective in the absence of other confounding disturbances such as nutrient pollution.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic networks are critical to biological diversity maintenance; however, their structures and functionality may be threatened by a swiftly changing world. In the Amazon, the increasing number of dams poses a large threat to biological diversity because they greatly alter and fragment the surrounding landscape. Tight coevolutionary interactions typical of tropical forests, such as the ant–myrmecophyte mutualism, where the myrmecophyte plants provide domatia nesting space to their symbiotic ants, may be jeopardized by the landscape changes caused by dams. We analyzed 31 ant–myrmecophyte mutualistic networks in undisturbed and disturbed sites surrounding Balbina, the largest Central Amazonian dam. We tested how ant–myrmecophyte networks differ among dam-induced islands, lake edges, and undisturbed forests in terms of species richness, composition, structure, and robustness (number of species remaining in the network after partner extinctions). We also tested how landscape configuration in terms of area, isolation, shape, and neighborhood alters the structure of the ant–myrmecophyte networks on islands. Ant–myrmecophytic networks were highly compartmentalized in undisturbed forests, and the compartments had few strongly connected mutualistic partners. In contrast, networks at lake edges and on islands were not compartmentalized and were negatively affected by island area and isolation in terms of species richness, density, and composition. Habitat loss and fragmentation led to coextinction cascades that contributed to the elimination of entire ant–plant compartments. Furthermore, many myrmecophytic plants in disturbed sites lost their mutualistic ant partners or were colonized by opportunistic, nonspecialized ants. Robustness of ant–myrmecophyte networks on islands was lower than robustness near lake edges and in undisturbed forest and was particularly susceptible to the extinction of plants. Beyond the immediate habitat loss caused by the building of large dams in Amazonia, persistent edge effects and habitat fragmentation associated with dams had large negative effects on animal–plant mutualistic networks.

There was no evidence that the seed-feeding tephritid fly Xyphosia miliaria preferentially oviposited on fertilized C. arvense. 3 At low thistle densities, X. miliaria showed a constant rate of resource exploitation. At higher thistle densities, a threshold was detected, above which additional buds were not attacked. 4 Parasitism attack was variable across host (tephritid) densities but levels of parasitism were consistently higher on the fertilized thistles. 5 Experimental manipulation of host-plant quality and resource availability (quantity) not only directly affects the tephritid population but also, indirectly, leads to high rates of parasitism. Both chemical and physical characteristics of host plants affect the performance of natural enemies. 6 Both top-down and bottom-up forces act to influence tephritid abundance, with bottom-up influences appearing to be the most important.},

We used meta‐analysis to analyze field experiments on trophic cascades in terrestrial arthropod‐dominated food webs to evaluate the overall magnitude of trophic cascades and conditions affecting their occurrence and strength. We found extensive support for the presence of trophic cascades in terrestrial communities. In the majority of experiments, predator removal led to increased densities of herbivorous insects and higher levels of plant damage. Cascades in which removing predators led to decreased herbivory also were detected but were less frequent and weaker, suggesting a predominantly three‐trophic‐level behavior of arthropod‐dominated terrestrial food webs. Despite the clear evidence that cascades often decreased plant damage, residual effects of predation produced either no or only minimal changes in overall plant biomass. Agricultural systems and natural communities exhibited similarly strong effects of predation on herbivore abundance. However, resulting effects on plant damage and community‐wide effects of trophic cascades on plant biomass usually were highly variable, and only in the managed agricultural systems did predators occasionally have strong indirect effects on plant biomass. Our meta‐analysis suggests that the effects of trophic cascades on the biomass of primary producers are weaker in terrestrial than aquatic food webs.},

	abstract = {We present a quantitative synthesis of trophic cascades in terrestrial systems using data from 41 studies, reporting 60 independent tests. The studies covered a wide range of taxa in various terrestrial systems with varying degrees of species diversity. We quantified the average magnitude of direct effects of carnivores on herbivore prey and indirect effects of carnivores on plants. We examined how the effect magnitudes varied with type of carnivores in the study system, food web diversity, and experimental protocol. A metaanalysis of the data revealed that trophic cascades were common among the studies. Exceptions to this general trend did arise. In some cases, trophic cascades were expected not to occur, and they did not. In other cases, the direct effects of carnivores on herbivores were stronger than the indirect effects of carnivores on plants, indicating that top‐down effects attenuated. Top‐down effects usually attenuated whenever plants contained antiherbivore defenses or when herbivore species diversity was high. Conclusions about the strength of top‐down effects of carnivores varied with the type of carnivore and with the plant‐response variable measured. Vertebrate carnivores generally had stronger effects than invertebrate carnivores. Carnivores, in general, had stronger effects when the response was measured as plant damage rather than as plant biomass or plant reproductive output. We caution, therefore, that conclusions about the strength of top‐down effects could be an artifact of the plant‐response variable measured. We also found that mesocosm experiments generally had weaker effect magnitudes than open‐plot field experiments or observational experiments. Trophic cascades in terrestrial systems, although not a universal phenomenon, are a consistent response throughout the published studies reviewed here. Our analysis thus suggests that they occur more frequently in terrestrial systems than currently believed. Moreover, the mechanisms and strengths of top‐down effects of carnivores are equivalent to those found in other types of systems (e.g., aquatic environments).},

This surpasses the 10\% target proposed a decade earlier, at the Caracas Congress2, for 9 out of 14 major terrestrial biomes1. Such uniform targets based on percentage of area have become deeply embedded into national and international conservation planning3. Although politically expedient, the scientific basis and conservation value of these targets have been questioned4,5. In practice, however, little is known of how to set appropriate targets, or of the extent to which the current global protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here, we combine five global data sets on the distribution of species and protected areas to provide the first global gap analysis assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in representing species diversity. We show that the global network is far from complete, and demonstrate the inadequacy of uniform—that is, ‘one size fits all’—conservation targets.},

Through its three main communication platforms (website, Google Groups, and Facebook), REBRE has reached more than 2,300 members, and although a more equitable distribution through Brazilian regions should still be reached, it is gradually becoming stronger and more representative.

	abstract = {Aim To propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants. Location The Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods We used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10\%, 17\% and 20\% of the Atlantic Forest extent. Results Current forest remnants cover only 12\% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17\% and 20\% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17\% and 20\% captured most species and represented on average 26\%–34\% of species’ distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios. Main conclusions Protection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17\% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.},

In this article, we investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-, 22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment planting of native trees.},

Eighteen “anthropogenic biomes” were identified through empirical analysis of global population, land use, and land cover. More than 75\% of Earth's ice-free land showed evidence of alteration as a result of human residence and land use, with less than a quarter remaining as wildlands, supporting just 11\% of terrestrial net primary production.

Historical perspectives increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of landscapes and provide a frame of reference for assessing modern patterns and processes. Historical records, however, are often too brief or fragmentary to be useful, or they are not obtainable for the process or structure of interest. Even where long historical time series can be assembled, selection of appropriate reference conditions may be complicated by the past influence of humans and the many potential reference conditions encompassed by nonequilibrium dynamics. These complications, however, do not lessen the value of history; rather they underscore the need for multiple, comparative histories from many locations for evaluating both cultural and natural causes of variability, as well as for characterizing the overall dynamical properties of ecosystems. Historical knowledge may not simplify the task of setting management goals and making decisions, but 20th century trends, such as increasingly severe wildfires, suggest that disregarding history can be perilous. We describe examples from our research in the southwestern United States to illustrate some of the values and limitations of applied historical ecology. Paleoecological data from packrat middens and other natural archives have been useful for defining baseline conditions of vegetation communities, determining histories and rates of species range expansions and contractions, and discriminating between natural and cultural causes of environmental change. We describe a montane grassland restoration project in northern New Mexico that was justified and guided by an historical sequence of aerial photographs showing progressive tree invasion during the 20th century. Likewise, fire scar chronologies have been widely used to justify and guide fuel reduction and natural fire reintroduction in forests. A southwestern network of fire histories illustrates the power of aggregating historical time series across spatial scales. Regional fire patterns evident in these aggregations point to the key role of interannual lags in responses of fuels and fire regimes to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (wet/dry cycles), with important implications for long-range fire hazard forecasting. These examples of applied historical ecology emphasize that detection and explanation of historical trends and variability are essential to informed management.},

Metacommunity models are now at the core of unified theories of biodiversity, but to date they have not addressed food web complexity. Here we show that metacommunity theory can explain the emergence of species-rich food webs with complex network topologies. Our analysis shows that network branching in the food web is maximized at intermediate colonization rates and limited dispersal scales, which also leads to concomitant peaks in species diversity. Increased food web complexity and species diversity are made possible by the structural role played by network branches that are supported by omnivore and generalist feeding links. Thus, in contrast to traditional food web theory, which emphasizes the destabilizing effect of omnivory feeding in closed systems, metacommunity theory predicts that these feeding links, which are commonly observed in empirical food webs, play a critical structural role as food webs assemble in space. As this mechanism functions at the metacommunity level, evidence for its operation in nature will be obtained through multiscale surveys of food web structure. Finally, we apply our theory to reveal the effects of habitat destruction on network complexity and metacommunity diversity.},

In natural ecosystems, many ecosystem functions are mediated by interactions between plants and animals, such as pollination and seed dispersal by animals, for which BEF relationships are little understood. Largely disconnected from BEF research, network ecology has examined the structural diversity of complex ecological networks of interacting species. Here, we provide an overview of the most important concepts in BEF and ecological network research and exemplify their applicability to natural ecosystems with examples from pollination and seed-dispersal studies. In a synthesis, we connect the structural approaches of network analysis with the trait-based approaches of BEF research and propose a conceptual trait-based model for understanding BEF relationships of plant–animal interactions in natural ecosystems. The model describes the sequential processes that determine the BEF relationship, i.e. the responses of species to environmental filters, the matching of species in ecological networks and the functionality of species in terms of their quantitative and qualitative contributions to plant demography and ecosystem functioning. We illustrate this conceptual integration with examples from mutualistic interactions and highlight its value for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss for multispecies interactions and ecosystem functions. We foresee that a better integration between BEF and network research will improve our mechanistic understanding of how biodiversity relates to the functioning of natural ecosystems. Our conceptual model is a step towards this integration between structural and functional biodiversity research.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is organised into complex ecological networks of interacting species in local ecosystems, but our knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation on such systems remains limited. We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales. There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation. Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change.},

	abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modularity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in experimental setups.},

	abstract = {Ecological restoration is critical for mitigating habitat loss and providing ecosystem services. However, restorations often have lower diversity than remnant, reference sites. Phylogenetic diversity is an important component of biodiversity and ecosystem function that has only recently been used to evaluate restoration outcomes. To move towards prediction in the restoration of biodiversity, it is necessary to understand how phylogenetic diversity of restorations compares with that of reference sites, and where deficits are found, to evaluate factors constraining phylogenetic diversity. We quantified plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity in eastern tallgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems on earth. We measured diversity at large (site) and small (plot) scales in 19 restored prairies and compared patterns with those from 41 remnant prairies. To evaluate how environmental conditions and management actions influence outcomes, we tested the effects of soil properties and seed mix composition on diversity of restorations. Restored prairies were less phylogenetically diverse than remnants at both spatial scales. On the other hand, the total species richness of remnant and restored prairies did not significantly differ, but remnants had higher native richness. Restored communities were taxonomically and phylogenetically distinct from remnants. Soil properties (moisture and pH) influenced phylogenetic diversity and composition. There were positive relationships between the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of seed mixes and resulting diversity of planted assemblages (excluding volunteer species). Species in seed mixes were more closely related than expected by chance, and several clades found in remnant prairies were missing from seed mixes. Synthesis and applications. Restored tallgrass prairies had lower phylogenetic diversity than remnant prairies, which may contribute to the widely observed phenomenon of restorations not being functionally equivalent to reference sites. It is encouraging for restoration efforts that seed mix phylogenetic diversity predicted phylogenetic diversity of planted assemblages. This indicates that designing phylogenetically diverse seed mixes for restoration is beneficial. In addition, clades found in reference sites that are missing from restoration seed mixes could be added to new or existing restorations to reduce gaps in phylogenetic diversity. Further work on the effects of management on phylogenetic diversity is needed to advance restoration of biodiversity.},

Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

	abstract = {Global environmental changes threaten biodiversity and the interactions between species, and food-web approaches are being used increasingly to measure their community-wide impacts. Here we review how parasitoid–host food webs affect biological control, and how their structure responds to environmental change. We find that land-use intensification tends to produce webs with low complexity and uneven interaction strengths. Dispersal, spatial arrangement of habitats, the species pool and community differences across habitats have all been found to determine how webs respond to landscape structure, though clear effects of landscape complexity on web structure remain elusive. The invasibility of web structures and response of food webs to invasion have been the subject of theoretical and empirical work respectively, and nutrient enrichment has been widely studied in the food-web literature, potentially driving dynamic instability and altering biomass ratios of different trophic levels. Combined with food-web changes observed under climate change, these responses of food webs could signal changes to biological control, though there have been surprisingly few studies linking food-web structure to pest control, and these have produced mixed results. However, there is strong potential for food-web approaches to add value to biological control research, as parasitoid–host webs have been used to predict indirect effects among hosts that share enemies, to study non-target effects of biological control agents and to quantify the use of alternative prey resources by enemies. Future work is needed to link food-web interactions with evolutionary responses to the environment and predator–prey interactions, while incorporating recent advances in predator biodiversity research. This holistic understanding of agroecosystem responses and functioning, made possible by food-web approaches, may hold the key to better management of biological control in changing environments.},

	abstract = {Tropical plant diversity is extraordinarily high at both local and regional scales. Many studies have demonstrated that natural enemies maintain local diversity via negative density dependence, but we know little about how natural enemies influence beta-diversity across habitats and/or regions. One way herbivores could influence plant beta-diversity is by driving allocation trade-offs that promote habitat specialization across resource gradients. We therefore predicted that increasing resource availability should be accompanied by increasing herbivory rates and decreasing plant allocation to defense. Second, relative abundances within plant lineages are predicted to reflect patterns of habitat specialization and allocation trade-offs. A phylogenetic context is vital not only to compare homologous plant traits (including defense strategies) across habitat types, but also to connect evolutionary trade-offs to patterns of species diversification in each phylogenetic lineage. We tested these predictions for trees in white-sand, clay terra firme, and seasonally flooded forests in Peru and French Guiana that represent the range of soil fertility, forest structure, and floristic compositions found throughout the Amazon region. We established 74 0.5-ha plots in these habitats and sampled all trees. Within 12 representative plots we marked newly expanding leaves of 394 saplings representing 68 species, including the most abundant species in each plot in addition to species from five focal lineages: Swartzia and Inga (Fabaceae), Protieae (Burseracaeae), Bombacoideae (Malvaceae), and Micropholis (Sapotaceae). We measured total leaf production rates for each sapling and calculated relative herbivory impact as the ratio between herbivory rate and leaf production rate. Herbivory rates averaged 2.1\% per month, did not correlate with leaf production rate, and were similar across habitats. Relative herbivore impacts exceeded leaf production rates for most species. Leaf production rate averaged 2.8\%, was significantly higher in seasonally flooded forests than the other two habitats, and exhibited significant correlations with specific leaf area. Species with high herbivory rates exhibited significantly lower relative abundances in terra firme forests. Overall, focal species within lineages present contrasting patterns regarding their herbivory rates and leaf production rate within habitats. These results highlight why a lineage-based approach is necessary when attempting to connect hypotheses regarding evolutionary trade-offs to community assembly patterns.},

We compared four 20-year periods, comparing periods of rapid land-use intensification and natural habitat loss (1930–1990) with a period of increased conservation investment (post-1990). We found that extensive species richness loss and biotic homogenisation occurred before 1990, whereas these negative trends became substantially less accentuated during recent decades, being partially reversed for certain taxa (e.g. bees in Great Britain and Netherlands). These results highlight the potential to maintain or even restore current species assemblages (which despite past extinctions are still of great conservation value), at least in regions where large-scale land-use intensification and natural habitat loss has ceased.},

Using historical records, we assessed the rate of extinction of bee and flower-visiting wasp species in Britain from the mid-19th century to the present. The most rapid phase of extinction appears to be related to changes in agricultural policy and practice beginning in the 1920s, before the agricultural intensification prompted by the Second World War, often cited as the most important driver of biodiversity loss in Britain. Slowing of the extinction rate from the 1960s onward may be due to prior loss of the most sensitive species and/or effective conservation programs.
“Green” revolution not so great for pollinators
It is increasingly recognized that many pollinator populations are declining. Ollerton et al. looked at British historical distribution records for bees and flower-visiting wasps across the past century. Though it is well known that agricultural intensification after World War II had a negative impact on many species, pollinator declines began in the decades preceding this time, when other changes were made to agricultural practices and policies.

	abstract = {Pollinators play a key role in the reproduction of most plant species, and pollinator and plant diversity are often related. We studied an experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better understanding of plant–pollinator community interactions and their temporal variability, because in non-experimental field surveys plant richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years, and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits. In conclusion, grasslands with high plant diversity enhance and stabilize frequent and diverse flower visitations, which should sustain effective pollination and plant reproduction.},

We show, by way of theoretical analyses with empirically informed parameters, that structural properties can alter the stability of mutualistic communities characterized by nonlinear functional responses among the interacting species. Specifically, community resilience is enhanced by increasing community size (species diversity) and the number of species interactions (connectivity), and through strong, symmetric interaction strengths of highly nested networks. As a result, mutualistic communities show largely positive complexity–stability relationships, in opposition to the standard paradox. Thus, contrary to the commonly-held belief that mutualism’s positive feedback destabilizes food webs, our results suggest that interplay between the structure and function of ecological networks in general, and consideration of mutualistic interactions in particular, may be key to understanding complexity–stability relationships of biological communities as a whole.},

We review the experimental evidence for both short-term and long-term apparent competition in phytophagous insect communities and discuss the possible interactions between apparent competition and intraguild predation or shared mutualists.

	abstract = {Pollinator network structure arising from the extent and strength of interspecific mutualistic interactions can promote species persistence and community robustness. However, environmental change may re-organise network structure limiting capacity to absorb or resist shocks and increasing species extinctions. We investigated if habitat disturbance and the level of mutualism dependence between species affected the robustness of insect–flower visitation networks Following a recently developed Stochastic Co-extinction Model (SCM), we ran simulations to produce the number of extinction episodes (cascade degree), which we correlated with network structure in undisturbed and disturbed habitat. We also explicitly modelled whether a species’ intrinsic dependence on mutualism affected the propensity for extinction cascades in the network. Habitat disturbance generated a gradient in network structure with those from disturbed sites being less connected, but more speciose and so larger. Controlling for network size (z-score standardisation against the null model) revealed that disturbed networks had disproportionately low linkage density, high specialisation, fewer insect visitors per plant species (vulnerability) and lower nestedness (NODF). This network structure gradient driven by disturbance increased and decreased different aspects of robustness to simulated plant extinction. Disturbance decreased the risk that an initial insect extinction would follow a plant species loss. Although, this effect disappeared when network size and connectance were standardised, suggesting the lower connectance of disturbed networks increased robustness to an initial secondary extinction. However, if a secondary extinction occurred then networks from disturbed habitat were more prone to large co-extinction cascades, likely resulting from a greater chance of extinction in these larger, speciose networks. Conversely, when species mutualism dependency was explicit in the SCM simulations the disturbed networks were disproportionately more robust to very large co-extinction cascades, potentially caused by non-random patterns of interaction between species differing in dependence on mutualism. Our results showed disturbance altered the size and the distribution of interspecific interactions in the networks to affect their robustness to co-extinction cascades. Controlling for effects due to network size and the interspecific variation in demographic dependence on mutualism can improve insight into properties conferring the structural robustness of networks to environmental changes.

IntroductionSeveral major developments in theoretical ecology have relied on either dynamical stability or numerical simulations, but oftentimes, they have found contradictory results. This is partly a result of not rigorously checking either the assumption that a steady state is feasible—meaning, all species have constant and positive abundances—or the dependence of results to model parameterization. Here, we extend the concept of structural stability to community ecology in order to account for these two problems. Specifically, we studied the set of conditions leading to the stable coexistence of all species within a community. This shifts the question from asking whether we can find a feasible equilibrium point for a fixed set of parameter values, to asking how large is the range of parameter values that are compatible with the stable coexistence of all species.
{\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/345/6195/1253497/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{\textgreater}The architecture of plant-animal mutualistic networks modulates the range of conditions leading to the stable coexistence of all species. The area of the different domains represents the structural stability of a model of mutualistic communities with a given network architecture. The nested networks observed in nature—illustrated here by the network at the bottom—lead to a maximum structural stability.
RationaleWe begin by disentangling the conditions of global stability from the conditions of feasibility of a steady state in ecological systems. To quantify the domain of stable coexistence, we first find its center (the structural vector of intrinsic growth rates). Next, we determine the boundaries of such a domain by quantifying the amount of variation from the structural vector tolerated before one species goes extinct. Through this two-step approach, we disentangle the effects of the size of the feasibility domain from how close a solution is to its boundary, which is at the heart of previous contradictory results. We illustrate our method by exploring how the observed architecture of mutualistic networks between plants and their pollinators or seed dispersers affects their domain of stable coexistence.
ResultsFirst, we determined the network architecture that maximizes the structural stability of mutualistic systems. This corresponds to networks with a maximal level of nestedness, a small trade-off between the number and intensity of interactions a species has, and a high level of mutualistic strength within the constraints of global stability. Second, we found that the large majority of observed mutualistic networks are close to this optimum network architecture, maximizing the range of parameters that are compatible with species coexistence.
ConclusionStructural stability has played a major role in several fields such as evolutionary developmental biology, in which it has brought the view that some morphological structures are more common than others because they are compatible with a wider range of developmental conditions. In community ecology, structural stability is the sort of framework needed to study the consequences of global environmental change—by definition, large and directional—on species coexistence. Structural stability will serve to assess both the range of variability a given community can withstand and why some community patterns are more widespread than others.
A structural approach to species interactions
What determines the stability of ecological networks? Rohr et al. devised a conceptual approach to study interactions between species that emphasizes the role of network structure (see the Perspective by Pawar). Using the example of mutualistic networks of communities of plants and their pollinator species, they show how the structure of networks can determine the persistence of the interactions. Network structures and architectures observed in nature intrinsically match the most stable solution. This approach has promise for application to questions of ecological community stability under global change.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1253497; see also p. 383
In theoretical ecology, traditional studies based on dynamical stability and numerical simulations have not found a unified answer to the effect of network architecture on community persistence. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework based on the concept of structural stability to explain such a disparity of results. We investigated the range of conditions necessary for the stable coexistence of all species in mutualistic systems. We show that the apparently contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies arise as a consequence of overseeing either the necessary conditions for persistence or its dependence on model parameterization. We show that observed network architectures maximize the range of conditions for species coexistence. We discuss the applicability of structural stability to study other types of interspecific interactions.
In ecology, structural stability influences the range of perturbations mutualistic networks can withstand. [Also see Perspective by Pawar]

In less than 20 yr populations of both trees have recruited leaf-miner faunas as diverse as those found on native oaks, but some species recorded on Q. acutissima and C. crenata never completed larval development. Discounting unsuccessful colonists, the introduced host with more local native congeners, Q. acutissima, has a greater diversity of associated miners than does C. crenata. Abundance of miners differs greatly among C. crenata, Q. acutissima, and Q. nigra, a native host for most species. Castanea crenata consistently has higher density of miners than does Q. acutissima, although most of this difference is attributable to two species. Larval survivorship and sources of mortality of all miners, and of numerically dominant species analyzed separately, also vary among host species. So does foliar nitrogen content. Survivorship of all miners is highest on C. crenata, intermediate on Q. acutissima, and lowest on Q. nigra, resulting in part from significantly lower parasitism rates on C. crenata than on Q. nigra. The greater foliar nitrogen content of C. crenata compared with Q. nigra also appears responsible for enhanced survivorship of at least one dominant miner on the introduced host.},

Adult B. tabaci females fed on a mixture of tomato, cabbage, cotton, cucumber, and kidney bean survived longer and laid more eggs than those fed exclusively on one of these plant species. Egg numbers per plant laid in the polyculture treatment were positively correlated with those laid on the same plant species in the monoculture treatments, and egg numbers per plant laid on tomato, cotton, and cucumber in the polyculture were significantly higher than those laid on the same plants in the monocultures. Concentrations of total protein and trehalose in B. tabaci were not significantly different after 7 days of feeding in the respective treatments, but activities of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) of B. tabaci in polyculture were lower than those in monoculture. Conversely, activities of trehalase, sucrase, and amylase in B. tabaci kept in polyculture were higher than those of insects from the monoculture. In each of the monoculture treatments, there was a negative correlation between AKP in B. tabaci and oviposition, and also between AKP and amylase. SOD and sucrase activities in B. tabaci were positively correlated with polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities in plants. In the plants damaged by whiteflies in the polyculture treatment, activities of SOD in cucumber, PPO in cotton and kidney bean, and POD in tomato and cucumber were lower than those in the monoculture treatments, whereas SOD in cabbage and catalase (CAT) in tomato in the polyculture treatment were higher than those in the monoculture treatments.},

This paper addresses the following questions for the insect-pollinated shrub Lavandula latifolia: (1) Are different populations of this pollinator-generalist plant similarly generalized? (2) Within a highly generalized population, are all plants similarly pollinator-generalists? Comparable values for richness in pollinator species were obtained from individual- or population-specific rarefaction curves as the projected number of distinct pollinator species implicated in 100 flower visits (SRAR100). Simple counts of pollinator species recorded per individual or population (SOBS) were weakly or nonsignificantly correlated with corresponding SRAR100 figures and closely correlated with flower visitation frequency. The pollination system of L. latifolia was highly generalized at the regional level, but populations differed greatly in pollinator species richness (SRAR100). Within the population intensively studied, individual plants had quite variable degrees of generalization, comparable in magnitude to variation among populations. It is concluded that generalization was not an invariant, species-level property in L. latifolia. Furthermore, pollinator diversity estimates based on SOBS data may be heavily contingent on aspects related to both research design (sampling effort) and biological phenomena (variation in pollinator abundance or visitation rates), which may either mask or distort underlying ecological patterns of interest.},

Results show both the two Helicoverpa species have a preference hierarchy for host plants. Compared to the fixed preference hierarchy of the specialist H. assulta, the generalist H. armigera exhibited extensive plasticity in feeding preference depending on the host plant experienced during larval development. Whereas the specialist H. assulta exhibited a rigid preference in both dual and triple-plant choice assays, our findings demonstrate that the generalist H. armigera expressed stronger preferences in the dual-plant choice assay than in the triple-plant choice assay.

	abstract = {Several bee species are experiencing significant population declines. As bees exclusively rely on pollen for development and survival, such declines could be partly related to changes in their host plant abundance and quality. Here, we investigate whether generalist bumblebee species, with stable population trends over the past years, adapted their diets in response to changes in the distribution and chemical quality of their pollen resources. We selected five common species of bumblebee in NW Europe for which we had a precise description of their pollen diet through two time periods ('prior to 1950' and '2004-2005'). For each species, we assessed whether the shift in their pollen diet was related with the changes in the suitable area of their pollen resources. Concurrently, we evaluated whether the chemical composition of pollen resources changed over time and experimentally tested the impact of new major pollen species on the development of B. terrestris microcolonies. Only one species (i.e. B. lapidarius) significantly included more pollen from resources whose suitable area expanded. This opportunist pattern could partly explain the expansion of B. lapidarius in Europe. Regarding the temporal variation in the chemical composition of the pollen diet, total and essential amino acid contents did not differ significantly between the two time periods while we found significant differences among plant species. This result is driven by the great diversity of resources used by bumblebee species in both periods. Our bioassay revealed that the shift to new major pollen resources allowed microcolonies to develop, bringing new evidence on the opportunist feature of bumblebee in their diets. Overall, this study shows that the response to pollen resource drift varies among closely related pollinators, and a species-rich plant community ensures generalist species to select a nutrient-rich pollen diet.},

	abstract = {The food quality of a given host plant tissue will influence the performance and may also affect the preference behavior of herbivorous animals. As nutrient contents and defense metabolite concentrations can vary significantly between different parts of a plant and change over time, herbivores are potentially confronted with diet differing in quality even when feeding on a single plant individual. Here we investigated to what extent feeding exclusively either on young or old, mature leaves of Brassica rapa or on a mixed diet of young and old leaves offered in alternating order affects the larval performance, food consumption, and the host preference behavior of adult mustard leaf beetles, Phaedon cochleariae. Analyzing different leaf quality traits, we found lower water contents, no changes in C:N ratio but more than threefold higher glucosinolate concentrations in young compared to old leaves. Individuals reared on mixed diet performed as well as animals reared on young leaves. Thus, compared to animals feeding exclusively on highly nutritious young leaves, diet-mixing individuals may balance the lower nutrient intake by a dilution of adverse secondary metabolites. Alternatively, they may integrate over the variation in their food, using a previously assimilated resource for growth at times of scarcity. Animals reared on old leaves grew less and had a prolonged larval developmental time, although they showed increased consumption indicating compensatory feeding. Additionally, we found that experience with a certain diet affected the preference behavior. Whereas individuals reared exclusively on young leaves preferred young over old leaves for feeding and oviposition, we did not find any preferences by animals reared exclusively on old leaves or by females reared on alternating diet. Thus, in contrast to positive feedbacks for animals reared on young leaves, an integrative growth of diet-mixing individuals potentially leads to a lack of feedback during development. Taken together, our results suggest that different diet regimes can lead to comparable performance of mustard leaf beetles but experienced feedbacks may differ and thus convey distinct diet preferences.

	abstract = {Adequate nutrition supports the development of healthy honey bee colonies. We give an overview of the nutritional demands of honey bee workers at three levels: (1) colony nutrition with the possibility of supplementation of carbohydrates and proteins; (2) adult nutrition and (3) larval nutrition. Larvae are especially dependant on protein and brood production is strongly affected by shortages of this nutrient. The number of larvae reared may be reduced to maintain the quality of remaining offspring. The quality of developing workers also suffers under conditions of larval starvation, leading to slightly affected workers. Larval starvation, alone or in combination with other stressors, can weaken colonies. The potential of different diets to meet nutritional requirements or to improve survival or brood production is outlined. We discuss nutrition-related risks to honey bee colonies such as starvation, monocultures, genetically modified crops and pesticides in pollen and nectar., Eine ausgewogene Ernährung mit ausreichend Proteinen, Kohlenhydraten, Fetten, Vitaminen und Mineralstoffen ist notwendig für das Überleben eines Bienenvolkes, die Entwicklung der Arbeiterinnen und die Aufzucht von Brut. Im Superorganismus Honigbiene sind diese drei Ebenen der Ernährung eng miteinander verknüpft (Abb. 1), und Defizite in einer dieser Ebenen wirken sich negativ auf die anderen aus.Für das Überleben des Volkes sind vor allem Kohlenhydrate notwendig. Eine Arbeiterin benötigt pro Tag etwa 4 mg verwertbaren Zucker. Allerdings sind nicht alle Zucker verwertbar, einige sind für Bienen giftig. Ebenfalls giftig ist Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) das sich bei thermischer Zersetzung und langer Lagerung aus Zuckern bildet. Der HMF Gehalt erhältlicher Maissirupe liegt zwischen 3,1 und 28,7 ppm, kann aber durch Lagerung bei zu hohen Temperaturen drastisch ansteigen und die Mortalität von Bienen erhöhen. Pollen ist die natürliche Proteinquelle von Bienen. Daraus bilden Ammenbienen ein proteinreiches Futter für die Brut. Ist nicht genügend Pollen vorhanden, reduziert das Bienenvolk die Zahl der produzierten Larven durch Kannibalismus. Ein Mangel von Protein in der Larval- oder Adultnahrung führt zur reduzierten Entwicklung der Brutfutterdrüsen und Ovarien sowie einer kürzeren Lebensdauer. Proteinmangel während der Larvalernährung führt darüber hinaus zu beeinträchtigter Thoraxentwicklung, Flugleistung und Verhaltensänderungen. Bei Pollenmangel können dem Bienenvolk andere Proteinquellen angeboten werden, Tabelle I zeigt die pro Tag konsumierten Mengen unterschiedlicher Diäten, deren Bestandteile, Proteingehalt und die Größe der untersuchten Einheit. Ein Proteingehalt zwischen 23 und 30 \% hat sich als zur Brutaufzucht geeignet erwiesen. Unseren Berechnungen zufolge erhält ein Volk mit jedem konsumierten Gramm etwa die Menge Protein die 4 Larven bis zur Verdeckelung benötigen.Pollen liefert ebenfalls Fette, die vor allem in der Larvalentwicklung benötigt werden. Honigbienen können Sterole nicht selbst herstellen, und verfüttern überwiegend 24-Methylen-Cholesterin an die Brut. Das tun sie, unter Verwendung von Körperreserven auch dann, wenn kein Cholesterin in der Nahrung vorhanden ist. Arbeiterinnen (oder symbiontische Mikroorganismen) sind in der Lage Vitamin C zu synthetisieren. Pyridoxin, ein Vitamin aus dem B-Komplex, ist hingegen notwendig für erfolgreiche Brutaufzucht. Obwohl fettlösliche Vitamine nicht essentiell für die Honigbiene sind, steigert ihre Anwesenheit in der Diät die Menge an produzierter Brut. Neben dem Verhungern oder der erwähnten Mangelernährung stellen einseitige Ernährung durch Monokulturen, genetisch modifizierte Pflanzen oder vom Menschen oder der Pflanze produzierte Giftstoffe die mit der Nahrung eingetragen werden Gefahren für die Honigbiene dar.},

	abstract = {Pollinators often sequentially visit one flower type while bypassing other equally rewarding flower types in the process. Many explanations for this pattern of flower choice in pollinators, known as flower constancy, have been proposed; yet, a sufficient answer to the question of why pollinators are constant still remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that flower constancy in pollinators is related to the number of traits distinguishing available flowers by measuring the floral selectivity (both constancy and preference) of bumblebees, Bombus impatiens, when artificial flower types differed in either colour only (variation in a single trait) or colour and other floral traits (variation in multiple traits). As expected, bees showed increased degrees of selectivity (constancy and preference) when available flower types differed in colour and other floral traits compared with when available flower types differed in colour only. In addition, bee foraging rates (measured in flowers visited per min) varied inversely with the number of variable floral traits added to colour but not with the number of colours. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that the mechanism underlying flower constancy in bumblebees is a limitation on their ability to effectively search for and/or remember multiple combinations of floral traits at the same time. We discuss the roles of floral-trait variation, flower constancy and pollinator cognitive limitations in the coevolution of flowering plants and their animal pollinators.},

Numerous recent developments in taxonomy, inventorying, monitoring, data compilation, statistical analysis and science communication facilitate overcoming these impediments in both policy and practice. We suggest as possible solutions for the public dilemma: better public information and marketing. For the political dilemma: red-listing, legal priority listing and inclusion in environmental impact assessment studies. For the scientific dilemma: parataxonomy, citizen science programs and biodiversity informatics. For the Linnean shortfall: biodiversity surrogacy, increased support for taxonomy and advances in taxonomic publications. For the Wallacean shortfall: funding of inventories, compilation of data in public repositories and species distribution modeling. For the Prestonian shortfall: standardized protocols for inventorying and monitoring, widespread use of analogous protocols and increased support for natural history collections.

A sharp rainfall gradient occurs between the two sites located 80 km apart. The wetter forest is located in San Lorenzo Protected Area on the Caribbean side of the isthmus, and the drier forest is a part of the Parque Natural Metropolitano close to Panama City on the Pacific slope. Host specificity was measured as effective specialization and recorded by probability methods based on abundance categories and feeding records from a total of 102 species of trees and lianas equally distributed between the two sites. The total material collected included more than 65,000 beetles of 2462 species, of which 306 species were shared between the two sites. The wet forest was 37\% more species rich than the dry forest due to more saproxylic species and flower visitors. Saproxylic species and flower visitors were also more host-specific in the wet forest. Leaf chewers showed similar levels of species richness and host specificity in both forests. The effective number of specialized species per plant species was higher in the wet forest. Higher levels of local alpha- and beta-diversity as well as host specificity based on present data from a tropical wet forest, suggests higher number of species at regional levels, a result that may have consequences for ecological estimates of global species richness.},

The surveys lay out a clear indicator of the rise of extreme views. The precursor is a nonlinear relation between the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme view and the fraction of individuals that includes also moderates, e.g., in politics, those who are “very conservative” versus “moderate to very conservative” ones. We propose an activation model of opinion dynamics with interaction rules based on the existence of individual “stubbornness” that mimics empirical observations. According to our modeling, the onset of nonlinearity can be associated to an abrupt bootstrap-percolation transition with cascades of extreme views through society. Therefore, it represents an early-warning signal to forecast the transition from moderate to extreme views. Moreover, by means of a phase diagram we can classify societies according to the percolative regime they belong to, in terms of critical fractions of extremists and people’s ties.},

Over the course of 6 wk, we targeted a small city in the center of Israel whose population is largely rightwing and religious. Based on the paradoxical thinking principles, the intervention involved transmission of messages that are extreme but congruent with the shared Israeli ethos of conflict. To examine the intervention’s effectiveness, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (prepost design) in which we sampled participants from the city population (n = 215) and compared them to a control condition (from different places of residence) with similar demographic and political characteristics (n = 320). Importantly, participants were not aware that the intervention was related to the questionnaires they answered. Results showed that even in the midst of a cycle of ongoing violence within the context of one of the most intractable conflicts in the world, the intervention led hawkish participants to decrease their adherence to conflict-supporting attitudes across time. Furthermore, compared with the control condition, hawkish participants that were exposed to the paradoxical thinking intervention expressed less support for aggressive policies that the government should consider as a result of the escalation in violence and more support for conciliatory policies to end the violence and promote a long-lasting agreement.},

	abstract = {Indirect interactions play an essential role in governing population, community and coevolutionary dynamics across a diverse range of ecological communities. Such communities are widely represented as bipartite networks: graphs depicting interactions between two groups of species, such as plants and pollinators or hosts and parasites. For over thirty years, studies have used indices, such as connectance and species degree, to characterise the structure of these networks and the roles of their constituent species. However, compressing a complex network into a single metric necessarily discards large amounts of information about indirect interactions. Given the large literature demonstrating the importance and ubiquity of indirect effects, many studies of network structure are likely missing a substantial piece of the ecological puzzle. Here we use the emerging concept of bipartite motifs to outline a new framework for bipartite networks that incorporates indirect interactions. While this framework is a significant departure from the current way of thinking about bipartite ecological networks, we show that this shift is supported by analyses of simulated and empirical data. We use simulations to show how consideration of indirect interactions can highlight differences missed by the current index paradigm that may be ecologically important. We extend this finding to empirical plant-pollinator communities, showing how two bee species, with similar direct interactions, differ in how specialised their competitors are. These examples underscore the need to not rely solely on network- and species-level indices for characterising the structure of bipartite ecological networks. This article is protected by copyright.

The grain legume faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is partially allogamous and benefits from bee pollination because bees transfer cross-pollen and improve seed set. Here, we study mechanisms behind bee pollination and address the question whether individual bee species differ in their efficiency to pollinate V. faba. We studied the foraging behaviour of bee pollinators in faba bean fields using transect walks, and the species-specific flower constancy based on pollen analyses. For the first time, we examined the species-specific effects of bee pollinators on seed set and degree of cross-fertilisation. We found that the two locally dominant pollinator species, Apis mellifera (56\% of all observed individuals) and Bombus terrestris agg. (37\%), did not provide efficient pollination service since they mostly robbed nectar. The less frequent species Bombus hortorum (4\%), however, revealed to be the most efficient pollinator. It exhibited only legitimate flower visits, high flower constancy and additionally increased seed set and the degree of cross-fertilisation more than any other species. Our study demonstrates especially that less frequent and more specialised pollinator species with long tongues improve pollination and cross-fertilisation of faba bean, which is of great importance in plant breeding and seed production.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Promoting ecosystem services, such as biological pest control, could help to reduce pesticide inputs while simultaneously sustaining a high productivity. The highly intensive rice production in Southeast Asia, where more than 20\% of the world's rice yield is produced, is challenged by devastating losses each year due to rice hoppers. This poses a great threat to the more than 3.5 billion people depending on rice as staple food. Egg parasitoids are among the most important natural enemies of rice hoppers and might be promoted with effective habitat management. However, empirical studies that focus on the management of parasitoid populations to enhance biological pest control in rice agroecosystems are largely lacking. We therefore analysed the effects of the availability of diverse habitats on hopper parasitoid performance, parasitism rates and pest control services, hypothesising that egg parasitoid abundance and pest control is positively influenced by diverse non-crop areas, which provide food resources as well as retreat areas for the fallow season. We experimentally tested the efficiency and abundance of egg parasitoids of Nilaparvata lugens and Nephotettix spp. in three study sites representing different levels of floral resources over the course of two rice growing seasons. We used mixed effect models to test whether habitat diversity positively influenced parasitoid abundance and subsequently reduces hatching rates of the hopper nymphs. Nephotettix spp. eggs were parasitized by Gonatocerus spp. and Paracentrobia spp. by 92.5\%; Nilaparvata lugens eggs were parasitized by Oligosita spp. and Anagrus spp by 93\%. In contrast to our hypothesis, we could demonstrate that additional floral resources do not significantly enhance parasitoid abundance and pest control in rice agroecosystems. Up to six times more parasitoids hatched from the bait plants exposed in the monoculture compared to the non-crop areas (p{\textless}0.05). All parasitoid genera except Anagrus spp. were found in rice fields in triple or quadruple numbers compared to the non-crop habitats (p{\textless}0.05). This was true also during the fallow period (p{\textless}0.05), where only ratoon rice was available to sustain hopper populations. In contrast to our hypotheses and findings from temperate productions systems, we found higher parasitoid abundance during all crop stages and increased hatching rates in the monocultures than in the non-crop habitats. The structural and temporal heterogeneity of rice crops and ratoon rice within the production area seemed to be sufficient to sustain high densities of parasitoid populations. We conclude that ecological intensification schemes should implement asynchronous planting cycles in rice systems to maintain or enhance parasitoids populations and their biocontrol services. In combination with reduced pesticide inputs, these measures might help to avoid yield losses due to rice hoppers in the future.},

	abstract = {Plant reproductive success is often the outcome of mutualistic and antagonistic plant–animal interactions, which can be moderated by landscape composition. Studies addressing single plant–animal interactions are common, but studies simultaneously considering multiple plant–animal interactions in a landscape context are still scarce. We selectively excluded flower-visiting insects on phytometer plants and quantified how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions shaped the reproductive success of a common annual plant, wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis). Floral herbivory by larvae of rape pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) strongly reduced fruit production, but could be minimized by insecticide application. Total seed production (the product of fruit production and seeds per fruit) strongly increased with pollinator visitation. On average, pollinator access to plants enhanced seed numbers by 754\%. Insecticide treatment almost redoubled this number. The landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitats in 1000 m radius) surrounding phytometer plants did not affect plant–animal interactions, presumably due to the high dispersal ability of both the pollen beetles and the major pollinators (syrphid flies, bumblebees). In conclusion, pest control increased reproductive success only in the case of sufficient pollination.},

	abstract = {Wild and domestic bees are essential for the pollination of crops in home gardens, agroforests and vegetable fields of rice smallholders. However, it remains unclear how rice fields and agroforests affect pollinator communities. We investigated the effects of habitat loss and isolation on four different components of bee diversity: abundance, species richness, functional diversity, and plant-pollinator interactions. Flower-visiting bees were recorded in a lowland rice-based production region on the Philippines. We sampled two different land use systems (agroforests and rice fields) and along a gradient of habitat isolation (isolated rice fields and rice fields connected to agroforests). All components of bee diversity were higher in agroforests than in rice fields. Especially above-ground nesting and long-tongued species were adversely affected by rice field habitats and body sizes decreased with isolation from agroforests. For plant-pollinator interactions we found that plants received less diverse pollinator visits in isolated rice fields. In conclusion, agroforests provide important food and nesting resources for bees that translate into taxonomically and functionally diverse pollinator communities as well as stable pollinator visitation networks. These cultivation systems should therefore be maintained or expanded to ensure pollination services and biodiversity conservation. On the contrary, rice fields provide habitat for only few generalist bee species and flower visitation is reduced in isolated rice fields, possibly also leading to impaired pollination of wild plants and crops. Connectivity between bee habitats located in rice production areas is probably disrupted even after a few hundred meters and should therefore be promoted by measures like flower strips in rice fields.},

	abstract = {Rapid growth of the world's human population has increased pressure on landscapes to deliver high levels of multiple ecosystem services, including food and fibre production, carbon storage, biodiversity conservation, and recreation. However, we currently lack general principles describing how to achieve this landscape multifunctionality. We combine theoretical simulations and empirical data on 14 ecosystem services measured across 150 grasslands in three German regions. In doing so, we investigate the circumstances under which spatial heterogeneity in a driver of ecosystem functioning (an “ecosystem-driver,” e.g., the presence of keystone species, land-use intensification, or habitat types) increases landscape-level ecosystem multifunctionality. Simulations based on theoretical data demonstrated that relationships between heterogeneity and landscape multifunctionality are highly variable and can range from nonsignificant to strongly positive. Despite this variability, we could identify criteria under which heterogeneity-landscape multifunctionality relationships were most strongly positive: this happened when multiple ecosystem services responded contrastingly (both positively and negatively) to an ecosystem-driver. These findings were confirmed using empirical data, which showed that heterogeneity in land-use intensity (LUI) promoted landscape multifunctionality in cases where functions with both positive (e.g., plant biomass) and negative (e.g., flower cover) responses to land use intensification were included. For example, the simultaneous provisioning of ecosystem functions related to forage production (generally profiting from land-use intensification), biodiversity conservation and recreation (generally decreasing with land-use intensification) was highest in landscapes consisting of sites varying in LUI. Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that there are general principles governing landscape multifunctionality. A knowledge of these principles may support land management decisions. For example, knowledge of relationships between ecosystem services and their drivers, such as land use type, can help estimate the consequences of increasing or decreasing heterogeneity for landscape-level ecosystem service supply, although interactions between landscape units (e.g., the movement of pollinators) must also be considered.},

	abstract = {Understanding how landscape characteristics affect biodiversity patterns and ecological processes at local and landscape scales is critical for mitigating effects of global environmental change. In this review, we use knowledge gained from human-modified landscapes to suggest eight hypotheses, which we hope will encourage more systematic research on the role of landscape composition and configuration in determining the structure of ecological communities, ecosystem functioning and services. We organize the eight hypotheses under four overarching themes. Section A: ‘landscape moderation of biodiversity patterns' includes (1) the landscape species pool hypothesis—the size of the landscape-wide species pool moderates local (alpha) biodiversity, and (2) the dominance of beta diversity hypothesis—landscape-moderated dissimilarity of local communities determines landscape-wide biodiversity and overrides negative local effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Section B: ‘landscape moderation of population dynamics' includes (3) the cross-habitat spillover hypothesis—landscape-moderated spillover of energy, resources and organisms across habitats, including between managed and natural ecosystems, influences landscape-wide community structure and associated processes and (4) the landscape-moderated concentration and dilution hypothesis—spatial and temporal changes in landscape composition can cause transient concentration or dilution of populations with functional consequences. Section C: ‘landscape moderation of functional trait selection’ includes (5) the landscape-moderated functional trait selection hypothesis—landscape moderation of species trait selection shapes the functional role and trajectory of community assembly, and (6) the landscape-moderated insurance hypothesis—landscape complexity provides spatial and temporal insurance, i.e. high resilience and stability of ecological processes in changing environments. Section D: ‘landscape constraints on conservation management' includes (7) the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis—landscape-moderated effectiveness of local conservation management is highest in structurally simple, rather than in cleared (i.e. extremely simplified) or in complex landscapes, and (8) the landscape-moderated biodiversity versus ecosystem service management hypothesis—landscape-moderated biodiversity conservation to optimize functional diversity and related ecosystem services will not protect endangered species. Shifting our research focus from local to landscape-moderated effects on biodiversity will be critical to developing solutions for future biodiversity and ecosystem service management.},

In contrast, we show that densities of bumblebees, an important pollinator group in agroecosystems, were not determined by the proportion of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes. Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales. Therefore, future conservation measures should consider the importance of mass flowering crops and the need for management schemes at landscape level to sustain vital pollination services in agroecosystems.},

However, few studies have considered landscape effects on the stability of ecosystem services. We tested whether isolation from florally diverse natural and semi-natural areas reduces the spatial and temporal stability of flower-visitor richness and pollination services in crop fields. We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes, crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flower-visitor richness, visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas. At 1 km from adjacent natural areas, spatial stability decreased by 25, 16 and 9\% for richness, visitation and fruit set, respectively, while temporal stability decreased by 39\% for richness and 13\% for visitation. Mean richness, visitation and fruit set also decreased with isolation, by 34, 27 and 16\% at 1 km respectively. In contrast, honey bee visitation did not change with isolation and represented {\textgreater} 25\% of crop visits in 21 studies. Therefore, wild pollinators are relevant for crop productivity and stability even when honey bees are abundant. Policies to preserve and restore natural areas in agricultural landscapes should enhance levels and reliability of pollination services.},

Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee responses varied slightly by biome. Our synthesis reveals that pollinator persistence will depend on both the maintenance of high-quality habitats around farms and on local management practices that may offset impacts of intensive monoculture agriculture.},

	abstract = {Bee pollinators are currently recorded with many different sampling methods. However, the relative performances of these methods have not been systematically evaluated and compared. In response to the strong need to record ongoing shifts in pollinator diversity and abundance, global and regional pollinator initiatives must adopt standardized sampling protocols when developing large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes. We systematically evaluated the performance of six sampling methods (observation plots, pan traps, standardized and variable transect walks, trap nests with reed internodes or paper tubes) that are commonly used across a wide range of geographical regions in Europe and in two habitat types (agricultural and seminatural). We focused on bees since they represent the most important pollinator group worldwide. Several characteristics of the methods were considered in order to evaluate their performance in assessing bee diversity: sample coverage, observed species richness, species richness estimators, collector biases (identified by subunit-based rarefaction curves), species composition of the samples, and the indication of overall bee species richness (estimated from combined total samples). The most efficient method in all geographical regions, in both the agricultural and seminatural habitats, was the pan trap method. It had the highest sample coverage, collected the highest number of species, showed negligible collector bias, detected similar species as the transect methods, and was the best indicator of overall bee species richness. The transect methods were also relatively efficient, but they had a significant collector bias. The observation plots showed poor performance. As trap nests are restricted to cavity-nesting bee species, they had a naturally low sample coverage. However, both trap nest types detected additional species that were not recorded by any of the other methods. For large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes with surveyors with different experience levels, we recommend pan traps as the most efficient, unbiased, and cost-effective method for sampling bee diversity. Trap nests with reed internodes could be used as a complementary sampling method to maximize the numbers of collected species. Transect walks are the principal method for detailed studies focusing on plant–pollinator associations. Moreover, they can be used in monitoring schemes after training the surveyors to standardize their collection skills.},

Hence, pollination is underestimated by international policies, which is particularly alarming in times of agricultural intensification and diminishing pollination services. In this study, exclusion experiments with strawberries showed bee pollination to improve fruit quality, quantity and market value compared with wind and self-pollination. Bee-pollinated fruits were heavier, had less malformations and reached higher commercial grades. They had increased redness and reduced sugar–acid–ratios and were firmer, thus improving the commercially important shelf life. Longer shelf life reduced fruit loss by at least 11\%. This is accounting for 0.32 billion US\$ of the 1.44 billion US\$ provided by bee pollination to the total value of 2.90 billion US\$ made with strawberry selling in the European Union 2009. The fruit quality and yield effects are driven by the pollination-mediated production of hormonal growth regulators, which occur in several pollination-dependent crops. Thus, our comprehensive findings should be transferable to a wide range of crops and demonstrate bee pollination to be a hitherto underestimated but vital and economically important determinant of fruit quality.},

	abstract = {Coexistence in bumblebee communities has largely been investigated at local spatial scales. However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250–3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes.},

	abstract = {1 Pollination is a vital ecosystem service, which is endangered by the ongoing declines of pollinators. These declines also affect bumblebees (Bombus spp.), which are important generalist pollinators in agricultural landscapes. Most studies focussing on the conservation of bumblebees have investigated the effects of local flower-rich habitats on bumblebee density and diversity. However, bumblebee densities do not necessarily correlate with the colonies’ reproductive success (i.e. the presence or absence of males and/or queens). 2 We analysed the effects of landscape-wide availability of mass flowering oilseed rape Brassica napus on the growth and sexual reproduction of Bombus terrestris colonies. Thirty-two young colonies were established and monitored in different resource environments represented by 16 landscapes (circular study areas with 3000 m radius) with large or small amounts of oilseed rape. As an indicator of colony growth, we used weight gain, which was strongly correlated with the numbers of brood cells in the colonies. 3 The colonies gained significantly more weight in study areas with large amounts of oilseed rape particularly during early colony stages. 4 Despite early weight gain, the colonies in study areas with large amounts of oilseed rape did not reproduce more successfully. The frequencies of colonies that produced males and/or queens did not differ between the two resource environments. 5 Synthesis and applications. Early mass flowering oilseed rape has a beneficial effect on colony growth, which however, does not translate into a greater likelihood of colonies producing sexual offspring. This may be due to food plant scarcity later in the colony cycle. Conservation measures should enhance food plant availability in agricultural landscapes, particularly during the most critical phases of the colony cycle: the colony establishment in spring and the reproductive phase in mid- to late summer.},

	abstract = {There is compelling evidence that more diverse ecosystems deliver greater benefits to people, and these ecosystem services have become a key argument for biodiversity conservation. However, it is unclear how much biodiversity is needed to deliver ecosystem services in a cost-effective way. Here we show that, while the contribution of wild bees to crop production is significant, service delivery is restricted to a limited subset of all known bee species. Across crops, years and biogeographical regions, crop-visiting wild bee communities are dominated by a small number of common species, and threatened species are rarely observed on crops. Dominant crop pollinators persist under agricultural expansion and many are easily enhanced by simple conservation measures, suggesting that cost-effective management strategies to promote crop pollination should target a different set of species than management strategies to promote threatened bees. Conserving the biological diversity of bees therefore requires more than just ecosystem-service-based arguments.},

	abstract = {Many experiments have shown that loss of biodiversity reduces the capacity of ecosystems to provide the multiple services on which humans depend1,2. However, experiments necessarily simplify the complexity of natural ecosystems and will normally control for other important drivers of ecosystem functioning, such as the environment or land use. In addition, existing studies typically focus on the diversity of single trophic groups, neglecting the fact that biodiversity loss occurs across many taxa3,4 and that the functional effects of any trophic group may depend on the abundance and diversity of others5,6. Here we report analysis of the relationships between the species richness and abundance of nine trophic groups, including 4,600 above- and below-ground taxa, and 14 ecosystem services and functions and with their simultaneous provision (or multifunctionality) in 150 grasslands. We show that high species richness in multiple trophic groups (multitrophic richness) had stronger positive effects on ecosystem services than richness in any individual trophic group; this includes plant species richness, the most widely used measure of biodiversity. On average, three trophic groups influenced each ecosystem service, with each trophic group influencing at least one service. Multitrophic richness was particularly beneficial for ‘regulating’ and ‘cultural’ services, and for multifunctionality, whereas a change in the total abundance of species or biomass in multiple trophic groups (the multitrophic abundance) positively affected supporting services. Multitrophic richness and abundance drove ecosystem functioning as strongly as abiotic conditions and land-use intensity, extending previous experimental results7,8 to real-world ecosystems. Primary producers, herbivorous insects and microbial decomposers seem to be particularly important drivers of ecosystem functioning, as shown by the strong and frequent positive associations of their richness or abundance with multiple ecosystem services. Our results show that multitrophic richness and abundance support ecosystem functioning, and demonstrate that a focus on single groups has led to researchers to greatly underestimate the functional importance of biodiversity.},

However, whether biodiversity loss is a major component of global change effects on multifunctionality in real-world ecosystems, as in experimental ones, remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed biodiversity, functional composition and 14 ecosystem services on 150 agricultural grasslands differing in land-use intensity. We also introduce five multifunctionality measures in which ecosystem services were weighted according to realistic land-use objectives. We found that indirect land-use effects, i.e. those mediated by biodiversity loss and by changes to functional composition, were as strong as direct effects on average. Their strength varied with land-use objectives and regional context. Biodiversity loss explained indirect effects in a region of intermediate productivity and was most damaging when land-use objectives favoured supporting and cultural services. In contrast, functional composition shifts, towards fast-growing plant species, strongly increased provisioning services in more inherently unproductive grasslands.},

	abstract = {Land-use intensification is a major threat to biodiversity. So far, however, studies on biodiversity impacts of land-use intensity (LUI) have been limited to a single or few groups of organisms and have not considered temporal variation in LUI. Therefore, we examined total ecosystem biodiversity in grasslands varying in LUI with a newly developed index called multidiversity, which integrates the species richness of 49 different organism groups ranging from bacteria to birds. Multidiversity declined strongly with increasing LUI, but changing LUI across years increased multidiversity, particularly of rarer species. We conclude that encouraging farmers to change the intensity of their land use over time could be an important strategy to maintain high biodiversity in grasslands., Although temporal heterogeneity is a well-accepted driver of biodiversity, effects of interannual variation in land-use intensity (LUI) have not been addressed yet. Additionally, responses to land use can differ greatly among different organisms; therefore, overall effects of land-use on total local biodiversity are hardly known. To test for effects of LUI (quantified as the combined intensity of fertilization, grazing, and mowing) and interannual variation in LUI (SD in LUI across time), we introduce a unique measure of whole-ecosystem biodiversity, multidiversity. This synthesizes individual diversity measures across up to 49 taxonomic groups of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria from 150 grasslands. Multidiversity declined with increasing LUI among grasslands, particularly for rarer species and aboveground organisms, whereas common species and belowground groups were less sensitive. However, a high level of interannual variation in LUI increased overall multidiversity at low LUI and was even more beneficial for rarer species because it slowed the rate at which the multidiversity of rare species declined with increasing LUI. In more intensively managed grasslands, the diversity of rarer species was, on average, 18\% of the maximum diversity across all grasslands when LUI was static over time but increased to 31\% of the maximum when LUI changed maximally over time. In addition to decreasing overall LUI, we suggest varying LUI across years as a complementary strategy to promote biodiversity conservation.},

The study tested the hypotheses that bumblebees have shorter foraging trips in environments that provide abundant resources than in environments that provide sparse resources, and that shorter foraging trips translate into greater colony growth. 2. Six even-aged Bombus terrestris colonies were established in contrasting resource environments. Three colonies had access to abundant resources (Phacelia tanacetifolia fields with high flower densities), and three colonies were placed in an environment with sparse resources (scattered semi-natural habitats with food plants at lower densities). 3. A total of 870 foraging trips of 220 marked B. terrestris foragers were observed using automated camcorder recordings. 4. The duration of foraging trips was shorter in environments with abundant resources (66 ± 4.6 min) than in environments with sparse resources (82 ± 3.7 min). Within 34 days colonies that had access to abundant resources gained significantly more weight (129 ± 40 g) than colonies foraging on sparse resources (19 ± 7 g). 5. Thus, the spatial distribution and quality of resources at landscape level affected the duration of foraging trips and the colony growth. It was concluded that future conservation schemes need to improve the spatial and temporal availability of resources in agricultural landscapes to counteract the ongoing decline of bumblebees.},

Here we show that landscape-level effects dominate functional community composition and can even buffer the effects of in-field management intensification on functional homogenization, and that animal communities in real-world managed landscapes show a unified response (across orders and guilds) to both landscape-scale simplification and in-field intensification. Adults and larvae with specialized feeding habits, species with shorter activity periods and relatively small body sizes are selected against in simplified landscapes with intense in-field management. Our results demonstrate that the diversity of land cover types at the landscape scale is critical for maintaining communities, which are functionally diverse, even in landscapes where in-field management intensity is high.},

	abstract = {Background. Up to 75\% of crop species benefit at least to some degree from animal pollination for fruit or seed set and yield. However, basic information on the level of pollinator dependence and pollinator contribution to yield is lacking for many crops. Even less is known about how insect pollination affects crop quality. Given that habitat loss and agricultural intensification are known to decrease pollinator richness and abundance, there is a need to assess the consequences for different components of crop production.Methods. We used pollination exclusion on flowers or inflorescences on a whole plant basis to assess the contribution of insect pollination to crop yield and quality in four flowering crops (spring oilseed rape, field bean, strawberry, and buckwheat) located in four regions of Europe. For each crop, we recorded abundance and species richness of flower visiting insects in ten fields located along a gradient from simple to heterogeneous landscapes.Results. Insect pollination enhanced average crop yield between 18 and 71\% depending on the crop. Yield quality was also enhanced in most crops. For instance, oilseed rape had higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents when adequately pollinated, the proportion of empty seeds decreased in buckwheat, and strawberries’ commercial grade improved; however, we did not find higher nitrogen content in open pollinated field beans. Complex landscapes had a higher overall species richness of wild pollinators across crops, but visitation rates were only higher in complex landscapes for some crops. On the contrary, the overall yield was consistently enhanced by higher visitation rates, but not by higher pollinator richness.Discussion. For the four crops in this study, there is clear benefit delivered by pollinators on yield quantity and/or quality, but it is not maximized under current agricultural intensification. Honeybees, the most abundant pollinator, might partially compensate the loss of wild pollinators in some areas, but our results suggest the need of landscape-scale actions to enhance wild pollinator populations.},

	abstract = {Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss1,2. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in β-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local (α)-diversity1,3 and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing β-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in α-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on β-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in β-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local α-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the α-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the β-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.},

	abstract = {Habitat management needs comprehensive perspectives, considering multiple ecosystem services at local and landscape scales. Stakeholder involvement with participatory research and development programmes for farmers is an essential part of it. Currently, ecological engineering by habitat management and participatory programmes and mass media campaigns are developed to counteract the adverse effects of ongoing intensification of rice production in Southeast Asia. These schemes often suggest the establishment of flower strips. Flower strips are a common measure to promote biodiversity and ecosystem service conservation in industrialised countries, since they aesthetically enrich production landscapes and provide supplementary food resources and shelter for natural enemies and pollinators. We review management options for biological pest control, pollination and cultural services in rice production landscapes and evaluate the parallel development of participatory programmes and mass media campaigns for sustainable rice production. Biological pest control, pollination services and landscape aesthetics could benefit from the establishment of flower strips in rice production landscapes. However, more experimental studies are needed to test the benefits of different plant species, potential interactions between local and landscape scale and interactions between different ecosystem services. Rice farmers should better appreciate their benefits from regulating ecosystem services and should be involved in the development and implementation of ecological engineering. Mass media campaigns and participatory programmes can motivate farmers, but their efficiency needs to be tested in different regions. Combining participatory approaches and mass media campaigns with the establishment of flower strips and other beneficial habitats has potential to increase the sustainability of rice production in Asia.
Zusammenfassung
Umfassende partizipatorische Ansätze sind notwendig, um multiple Ökosystemdienstleistungen in Agrarökosystemen auf lokaler und Landschaftsebene zu managen. Dabei sollten alle Interessenvertreter involviert werden. Insbesondere Landwirte sollten an partizipatorischen Trainingsmaßnahmen, Forschungs- und Umsetzungsprojekten mitwirken. Um der starken Intensivierung im Reisanbau entgegenzuwirken, werden Umweltmaßnahmen zum nachhaltigen Management der Reisökosysteme in Südostasien entwickelt (ecological engineering). Dabei werden partizipatorische Programme und Kampagnen in Massenmedien mit der Etablierung von Blühstreifen verknüpft. Blühstreifen werden in Industriestaaten häufig als Agrarumweltmaßnahme implementiert, da sie das Landschaftsbild verbessern und zusätzliche Nahrungsressourcen und Schutzräume für Bestäuber und Gegenspieler von Schädlingen bieten. Wir analysieren die Wirkung von ecological-engineering-Maßnahmen auf mehrere Ökosystemdienstleistungen (Bestäubung und natürliche Schädlingskontrolle, Landschaftsbild) in Reisökosystemen. Zudem evaluieren wir partizipatorische Programme und Kampagnen in Massenmedien als Instrumente, um Reisbauern stärker in ecological-engineering-Programme einzubinden. Das Landschaftsbild, die natürliche Schädlingskontrolle und die Bestäubungsleistung in Reisökosystemen können durch Blühstreifen verbessert werden. Geeignete Pflanzenarten zur Förderung von Gegenspielern und Bestäubern sollten allerdings noch in experimentellen Studien ausgewählt werden. Zudem sollten mögliche Interaktionen zwischen lokalen und Landschaftseffekten untersucht werden und die Reisbauern bei der Entwicklung von ecological-engineering-Programmen mitwirken, um besser ihre Vorteile von den regulierenden Ökosystemdienstleistungen wertschätzen zu können. Partizipatorische Programme und Kampagnen in Massenmedien eignen sich um Reisbauern zu motivieren, an den Programmen teilzunehmen, aber ihre Wirksamkeit muss noch in verschiedenen Regionen getestet werden. Die Kombination von partizipatorischen Programmen und Kampagnen in Massenmedien und die Etablierung von Blühstreifen kann dazu beitragen, dass Reis in Asien zukünftig nachhaltiger produziert wird.},

	abstract = {Species diversity promotes the delivery of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, the relative functional importance of rare and common species in driving the biodiversity–multifunctionality relationship remains unknown. We studied the relationship between the diversity of rare and common species (according to their local abundances and across nine different trophic groups), and multifunctionality indices derived from 14 ecosystem functions on 150 grasslands across a land-use intensity (LUI) gradient. The diversity of above- and below-ground rare species had opposite effects, with rare above-ground species being associated with high levels of multifunctionality, probably because their effects on different functions did not trade off against each other. Conversely, common species were only related to average, not high, levels of multifunctionality, and their functional effects declined with LUI. Apart from the community-level effects of diversity, we found significant positive associations between the abundance of individual species and multifunctionality in 6\% of the species tested. Species-specific functional effects were best predicted by their response to LUI: species that declined in abundance with land use intensification were those associated with higher levels of multifunctionality. Our results highlight the importance of rare species for ecosystem multifunctionality and help guiding future conservation priorities.},

Changes in predator communities might alter ecosystem services and subsequently sustainable management but these links have received little attention to date. Here, for the first time, we manipulated ant and flying vertebrate (birds and bats) access to oil palms in six smallholder plantations in Sumatra (Indonesia) and measured effects on arthropod communities, related ecosystem functions (herbivory, predation, decomposition and pollination) and crop yield. Arthropod predators increased in response to reductions in ant and bird access, but the overall effect of experimental manipulations on ecosystem functions was minimal. Similarly, effects on yield were not significant. We conclude that ecosystem functions and productivity in oil palm are, under current levels of low pest pressure and large pollinator populations, robust to large reductions of major predators.},

Global models are needed to better characterise, project, and mitigate bees' responses to these human impacts. The available data are, however, geographically and taxonomically unrepresentative; most data are from North America and Western Europe, overrepresenting bumblebees and raising concerns that model results may not be generalizable to other regions and taxa. To assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have collated from the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity at sites facing land-use change and intensification, and assess whether bee responses to these pressures vary across 11 regions (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe; North, Central and South America; Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia; Middle and Southern Africa) and between bumblebees and other bees. Our analyses highlight strong regionally-based responses of total abundance, species richness and Simpson's diversity to land use, caused by variation in the sensitivity of species and potentially in the nature of threats. These results suggest that global extrapolation of models based on geographically and taxonomically restricted data may underestimate the true uncertainty, increasing the risk of ecological surprises.},

	abstract = {The degradation of natural forests to modified forests threatens subtropical and tropical biodiversity worldwide. Yet, species responses to forest modification vary considerably. Furthermore, effects of forest modification can differ, whether with respect to diversity components (taxonomic or phylogenetic) or to local (α-diversity) and regional (β-diversity) spatial scales. This real-world complexity has so far hampered our understanding of subtropical and tropical biodiversity patterns in human-modified forest landscapes. In a subtropical South African forest landscape, we studied the responses of three successive plant life stages (adult trees, saplings, seedlings) and of birds to five different types of forest modification distinguished by the degree of within-forest disturbance and forest loss. Responses of the two taxa differed markedly. Thus, the taxonomic α-diversity of birds was negatively correlated with the diversity of all plant life stages and, contrary to plant diversity, increased with forest disturbance. Conversely, forest disturbance reduced the phylogenetic α-diversity of all plant life stages but not that of birds. Forest loss neither affected taxonomic nor phylogenetic diversity of any taxon. On the regional scale, taxonomic but not phylogenetic β-diversity of both taxa was well predicted by variation in forest disturbance and forest loss. In contrast to adult trees, the phylogenetic diversity of saplings and seedlings showed signs of contemporary environmental filtering. In conclusion, forest modification in this subtropical landscape strongly shaped both local and regional biodiversity but with contrasting outcomes. Phylogenetic diversity of plants may be more threatened than that of mobile species such as birds. The reduced phylogenetic diversity of saplings and seedlings suggests losses in biodiversity that are not visible in adult trees, potentially indicating time-lags and contemporary shifts in forest regeneration. The different responses of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity to forest modifications imply that biodiversity conservation in this subtropical landscape requires the preservation of natural and modified forests.},

Yet, in times of world-wide pollinator declines, effects of global change on pollinator FD remain poorly understood. Loss of natural habitat and exotic plant invasions are two major drivers of global change that particularly threaten pollinator diversity. In a subtropical South African landscape, we investigated changes in the FD of flower visitor assemblages on native and exotic plants along gradients of natural habitat loss and relative abundance of exotic plants. We used a data set of 1434 flower visitor individuals sampled on 131 focal plants and calculated the FD in three flower visitor traits that are strongly related to plant–flower visitor interactions and pollination processes: proboscis length, proboscis diameter and body length. Multivariate FD of flower visitors decreased with both increasing natural habitat loss and relative exotic abundance. Importantly, changes in FD went beyond those in flower visitor richness. Furthermore, flower visitor richness was not related to either natural habitat loss or relative exotic abundance. Loss in multivariate FD seemed to be mediated by complementary reductions of FD in proboscis length with natural habitat loss and of FD in body length with both global change drivers. Correspondingly, we recorded lower abundances of long-tongued flower visitors with natural habitat loss and reduced variance in body size with both drivers. In contrast, FD in proboscis diameter was unaffected by either driver. All effects of the two global change drivers were non-interactive. Our results show that both natural habitat loss and exotic plants negatively affect flower visitor FD, which may imperil pollination of specialized plant species in degraded habitats. In contrast, flower visitor richness may not cover all facets of flower visitor FD that are relevant to pollination processes. Distinct responses of visitor traits to the two drivers suggest limited options to infer relations of one trait to another. Finally, additive effects of natural habitat loss and exotic plant invasions highlight the need to consider multiple drivers of global change when investigating ecosystem processes at a community scale.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and plant invasions are two major drivers of global change in subtropical and tropical ecosystems. Both lead to a loss of biodiversity and alter species interactions, which may imperil vital ecosystem processes such as seed dispersal by frugivores. Reponses of frugivores to disturbance are often linked to their specialization on certain habitats or resources. Yet, it is poorly understood how habitat loss and plant invasion structure interactions between plants and different habitat or feeding guilds. Here we investigated whether visitation rates of frugivores change guild-specifically with increasing habitat loss and invasion level in a heterogeneous subtropical landscape. In 756 h of observations, we recorded 1446 plant–frugivore interactions among 18 plant species and 42 avian frugivore species. Visitation rates of forest specialists decreased with increasing habitat loss, but not with changes in invasion level. In contrast forest generalists and forest visitors were unaffected by either driver. Similarly, obligate frugivores that overall showed a generalized fruit choice were unaffected by habitat loss and changes in invasion level. Contrary, visitation rates of specialized partial and opportunistic frugivores decreased with higher invasion level. Importantly, the negative effect of plant invasion on partial frugivores was more pronounced as habitat loss in the same study site increased, indicating a synergistic effect of the two drivers. The implications of our study are twofold: first, frugivores respond guild-specifically to habitat loss and plant invasion. Thereby forest dependency is mainly related to habitat loss, and degree of frugivory mainly related to plant invasion. Forest generalists and obligate frugivores in turn may play a key-role for forest regeneration in disturbed forest landscapes. Second, particularly frugivores with a specialized fruit choice may be threatened by synergistic effects between habitat loss and plant invasion.},

	abstract = {The continuing spread of exotic plants and increasing human land-use are two major drivers of global change threatening ecosystems, species and their interactions. Separate effects of these two drivers on plant–pollinator interactions have been thoroughly studied, but we still lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive effects. In a subtropical South African landscape, we studied 17 plant–pollinator networks along two gradients of relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity. In general, pollinator visitation rates were lower on exotic plants than on native ones. Surprisingly, while visitation rates on native plants increased with relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity, pollinator visitation on exotic plants decreased along the same gradients. There was a decrease in the specialization of plants on pollinators and vice versa with both drivers, regardless of plant origin. Decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed to be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists. However, contrary to expectations, we detected no interactive effects between the two drivers. Our results suggest that exotic plants and land-use promote generalist plants and pollinators, while negatively affecting specialized plant–pollinator interactions. Weak integration and high specialization of exotic plants may have prevented interactive effects between exotic plants and land-use. Still, the additive effects of exotic plants and land-use on specialized plant–pollinator interactions would have been overlooked in a single-factor study. We therefore highlight the need to consider multiple drivers of global change in ecological research and conservation management.},

	abstract = {One goal of wildflower plantings is to promote biodiversity in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Flower visitors of wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically important species. However, most studies on flower visitors of wildflower plantings have focused on single or few prominent taxa (e.g., wild bees and hoverflies). In contrast, it remains largely unresolved how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14 wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their surrounding landscape context within a 500m radius (percentage arable land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were sampled in the early (May–June) and late (June–July) flowering season and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1\%) of all 322 visiting species ({\textless}50.0\% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241 non-prominent ‘other’ visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g. predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees, wildflower plantings support a high diversity of functionally complementary flower-visitor species from complex to structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where prominent providers have been lost. Assessments of the value of wildflower plantings to biodiversity conservation and agriculture require a shift away from solely focusing on prominent taxa and towards a more holistic appreciation of the entire flower-visitor community.},

	abstract = {There is growing demand for pollination services in agricultural production, which contrasts with declines of wild and managed pollinator populations. Macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) is a mass-flowering crop that depends on pollination services and is increasingly cultivated in South Africa. We studied the crop’s pollination in South African orchards considering variation in landscape context and the spatial arrangement of managed honeybees (Apis mellifera). We conducted pollination experiments and pollinator observations on macadamia trees along a distance gradient from orchard edges that bordered either near-natural or human-modified habitats. In addition, we mapped position and density of honeybee apiaries at orchard-level. Nut set of macadamia trees strongly relied on animal-mediated pollination: pollinator exclusion reduced the initial nut set (3 weeks after pollination) by 80\% and the final nut set (15 weeks after pollination) by 54\%. Supplemental hand-pollination of otherwise untreated flowers increased initial and final nut set by 66\% and 44\%, respectively, indicating substantial pollination limitation. The landscape context only weakly affected pollinator visitation to macadamia trees, with reduced visitation closer to orchard edges bordering human-modified habitats. Furthermore, we observed almost no wild pollinator species. Instead, honeybees constituted 99\% of all visits, whereby honeybee visitation rates increased with a tree’s connectivity to apiaries. However, neither initial nor final nut was related to visitation rates, and the final nut set was actually reduced where honeybee colony density was high, with a predicted 50\% reduction in final nut set between the lowest and highest colony densities. Our study demonstrates a strong pollination limitation in South African macadamia orchards, where managed honeybees fail at delivering the increasing need for pollination services. Indeed, increasing their colony densities may further limit their pollination efficiency. A pollination management that also includes non-Apis managed pollinators and wild pollinators is possibly needed to increase nut set and provide solutions for increasing pollination service demands. In intensive macadamia orchards, this can also necessitate the need for more pollinator-friendly management practices, including habitat restoration and reduced pesticide application.},

	abstract = {Field-margin diversification through conservation and restoration of hedgerows is becoming a prominent intervention for promoting biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in intensive agricultural landscapes. However, how increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape can affect ecosystem services has rarely been considered. Here, we assessed the effect of increased field-margin complexity at the local scale and increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape on the provision of pest control, weed control and potential pollination. Locally, three types of field margin were compared as follows: (i) standard grass margin, (ii) simple hedgerow and (iii) complex hedgerow, along two independent gradients of hedgerow cover and arable land cover in the landscape. We performed an exclusion experiment to measure biological control of cereal aphids and assessed natural enemy and pest abundance in the field. We sampled plant weed communities and performed a phytometer experiment to test the effects of pollinators on plant reproductive success. At the local scale, planting a new hedgerow or improving its structural complexity and vegetation diversity did not enhance the delivery of ecosystem services in the neighbouring field. However, high cover of hedgerows in the landscape enhanced aphid parasitism (from 12 to 18\%) and potential pollination (visitation rate and seed set increased up to 70\%) irrespective of local margin quality. The cover of arable land in the landscape reduced the abundance of plant-dwelling predators and weed diversity, but did not affect the delivery of the investigated ecosystem services. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the key importance of the surrounding landscape context, rather than local factors, to the delivery of ecosystem services. This suggests a need for new policies that pay particular attention to the conservation of hedgerows at large scales for promoting multiple ecosystem services in agroecosystems. Specifically, hedgerows can serve to develop a network of ecological corridors that can facilitate the movement of beneficial organisms, such as pollinators and natural enemies in the agricultural matrix. Such interventions may be a ‘low cost–high benefit solution’, since farmers can create or conserve high-quality habitats taking little or no land from crop production and without the need to change their crop management.},

We measured the density and species richness of butterflies on organic farms, conventional farms and grassland nature reserves in 16 landscapes. Organic farms supported a higher density of butterflies than conventional farms, but a lower density than reserves. Using our data, we predict the optimal land-use strategy to maintain yield whilst maximizing butterfly abundance under different scenarios. Farming conventionally and sparing land as nature reserves is better for butterflies when the organic yield per hectare falls below 87\% of conventional yield. However, if the spared land is simply extra field margins, organic farming is optimal whenever organic yields are over 35\% of conventional yields. The optimal balance of land sparing and wildlife-friendly farming to maintain production and biodiversity will differ between landscapes.},

We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.
A model determines the consequences for wildlife of the trade-off between yield intensity of land under cultivation and amount of land under cultivation.

Most studies that try to address this question suffer from flaws in sampling design, inappropriate metrics, and/or failure to measure biodiversity baselines. We discuss how these failings can be addressed, and what existing information tells us about the key debates on this topic. The evidence available suggests that trade-offs between biodiversity and yield are prevalent. While there are some wildlife-friendly farming systems that support high species richness, a large proportion of wild species cannot survive in even the most benign farming systems. To conserve those species, protection of wild lands will remain essential. Sustainable intensification could help to facilitate sparing of such lands, provided that as much attention is given to protecting habitats as to raising yields. We discuss the general circumstances under which yield increases can facilitate land sparing, recognising that policies and social safeguards will need to be context-specific. In some situations, bringing degraded lands into production could help reduce pressure on wild lands, but much more information is needed on the biodiversity implications of using degraded lands. We conclude that restricting human requirements for land globally will be important in limiting the impacts on biodiversity of increasing food production. To achieve this, society will need to integrate explicit conservation objectives into local, regional and international policies affecting the food system.},

In land sparing, homogeneous areas of farmland are managed to maximize yields, while separate reserves target biodiversity conservation. Wildlife-friendly farming, in contrast, integrates conservation and production within more heterogeneous landscapes. Different scientific traditions underpin the two approaches. Land sparing is associated with an island model of modified landscapes, where islands of nature are seen as separate from human activities. This simple dichotomy makes land sparing easily compatible with optimization methods that attempt to allocate land uses in the most efficient way. In contrast, wildlife-friendly farming emphasizes heterogeneity, resilience, and ecological interactions between farmed and unfarmed areas. Both social and biophysical factors influence which approach is feasible or appropriate in a given landscape. Drawing upon the strengths of each approach, we outline broad policy guidelines for conservation in agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {The structure of species interaction networks is important for species coexistence, community stability and exposure of species to extinctions. Two widespread structures in ecological networks are modularity, i.e. weakly connected subgroups of species that are internally highly interlinked, and nestedness, i.e. specialist species that interact with a subset of those species with which generalist species also interact. Modularity and nestedness are often interpreted as evolutionary ecological structures that may have relevance for community persistence and resilience against perturbations, such as climate-change. Therefore, historical climatic fluctuations could influence modularity and nestedness, but this possibility remains untested. This lack of research is in sharp contrast to the considerable efforts to disentangle the role of historical climate-change and contemporary climate on species distributions, richness and community composition patterns. Here, we use a global database of pollination networks to show that historical climate-change is at least as important as contemporary climate in shaping modularity and nestedness of pollination networks. Specifically, on the mainland we found a relatively strong negative association between Quaternary climate-change and modularity, whereas nestedness was most prominent in areas having experienced high Quaternary climate-change. On islands, Quaternary climate-change had weak effects on modularity and no effects on nestedness. Hence, for both modularity and nestedness, historical climate-change has left imprints on the network structure of mainland communities, but had comparably little effect on island communities. Our findings highlight a need to integrate historical climate fluctuations into eco-evolutionary hypotheses of network structures, such as modularity and nestedness, and then test these against empirical data. We propose that historical climate-change may have left imprints in the structural organisation of species interactions in an array of systems important for maintaining biological diversity.},

	abstract = {Aim We aim to characterize the macroecological patterns in the structure of mutualistic seed-dispersal networks. Tropical areas hold more species than temperate ones. This difference in species number may favour ecological processes that minimize interspecific competition in species-rich areas. There is theoretical evidence that both modularity (i.e. the presence of semi-independent groups of highly interacting species) and nestedness (i.e. specialists interact with a subset of the species interacting with generalists) reduce the effects of competition. Thus, we expect high degrees of modularity or nestedness at low latitudes in seed-dispersal networks. Moreover, we test whether climate, topography and human impact influence network structure. Location Thirty-four qualitative and 21 weighted seed-dispersal interaction networks located world-wide. Methods We related the degree of modularity and nestedness of seed-dispersal interaction networks with latitude. To disentangle the macroecological drivers of network structure, we also associated modularity/nestedness with species richness, altitudinal range, human impact and an array of climate predictors: precipitation, temperature, precipitation/temperature seasonality and historical climate-change velocity and anomaly. Results Binary networks showed stronger macroecological patterns than weighted networks. Latitude was unrelated to the structure of seed-dispersal networks, but more nested assemblages were species rich and were located in areas with a high degree of human impact, high temperature seasonality, low precipitation, and, especially on the mainland, high stability in precipitation. Modular networks were species rich and found in areas with low human impact. For both nestedness and modularity, the effects of species richness and human impact were especially strong and consistent. Main conclusions As for previous macroecological studies of mutualistic networks, we found that the structure of seed-dispersal assemblages was related to current and historical climate. The largest influences on nestedness and modularity, however, were the number of competing species and the degree of human impact. This suggests that human disturbance, not just climate, is an important factor determining the structure of a seed-dispersal network.},

Earthworms are a dominant non-pest component of the diet of P. melanarius which help sustain the beetles during periods when the pest population is low or absent. In this study we wanted to test whether this predator exercises prey choice among different earthworm species or ecological groups. High levels of genetic diversity within morphological species of earthworm necessitated the development of primers that were specific not just to species but lineages and sub-lineages within species as well. Gut samples from beetles were analysed using multiplex-PCR and fluorescent-labelled primers. Calibratory feeding trials were undertaken to calculate median detection times for prey DNA following ingestion. Extensive testing demonstrated that the primers were species-specific, that detection periods were negatively related to amplicon size and that meal size had a highly significant effect on detection periods. Monte Carlo simulations showed that, in general, worms were being predated in proportion to their densities in the field with little evidence of prey choice, other than probable avoidance of the larger, deep-living species. There was no evidence that epigeic species were being taken preferentially in comparison with endogeic species. There was also no evidence that defensive secretions by Allolobophora chlorotica reduced predation pressure on this species by P. melanarius. We concluded that any management system that increases earthworm densities generally, regardless of component species, is likely to be optimal for increasing numbers of this beneficial beetle predator.},

Polymerase chain reaction primers were developed for the amplification, from spider gut samples, of DNA from three of the most abundant species of Collembola in wheat crops in Europe, namely Isotoma anglicana, Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and Entomobrya multifasciata. The primers amplified fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and were designed following alignment of comparable sequences for a range of predator and prey species. Each of the primer pairs proved to be species-specific to a Collembola species, amplifying DNA fragments from 211 to 276 base pairs in length. Following consumption of a single collembolan, prey DNA was detectable in 100\% of spiders after 24 h of digestion. We report the first use of DNA-based techniques to detect predation by arthropods on natural populations of prey in the field. All three species of Collembola were consumed by the spiders. By comparing the ratios of the Collembola species in the field with the numbers of spiders that gave positive results for each of those species, it was possible to demonstrate that the spiders were exercising prey choice. Overall, a single target species of Collembola was eaten by 48\% of spiders while a further 16\% of spiders contained DNA from two different species of Collembola. Preference was particularly evident for I. anglicana, the species most frequently found in spider guts yet the least numerous of the three target species in the field.},

We assessed the effects of experimental single bumblebee species removals on the structure of entire flower visitation networks. We hypothesized that network structure would change following processes linking interspecific competition with dietary niche breadth. We found that single pollinator species losses impact pollination network structure: resource complementarity decreased, while resource overlap increased. Despite marginally increased connectance, fewer plant species were visited after species removals. These changes may have negative functional impacts, as complementarity is important for maintaining biodiversity–ecological functioning relationships and visitation of rare plant species is critical for maintaining diverse plant communities.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien plants can compete with native plants for resources, and may ultimately decrease native plant diversity and/or abundance in invaded sites. This could have consequences for native mutualistic interactions, such as pollination. Although invasive plants often become highly connected in plant-pollinator interaction networks, in temperate climates they usually only flower for part of the season. Unless sufficient alternative plants flower outside this period, whole-season floral resources may be reduced by invasion. We hypothesized that the cessation of flowering of a dominant invasive plant would lead to dramatic, seasonal compositional changes in plant-pollinator communities, and subsequent changes in network structure. We investigated variation in floral resources, flower-visiting insect communities, and interaction networks during and after the flowering of invasive Rhododendron ponticum in four invaded Irish woodland sites. Floral resources decreased significantly after R. ponticum flowering, but the magnitude of the decrease varied among sites. Neither insect abundance nor richness varied between the two periods (during and after R. ponticum flowering), yet insect community composition was distinct, mostly due to a significant reduction in Bombus abundance after flowering. During flowering R. ponticum was frequently visited by Bombus; after flowering, these highly mobile pollinators presumably left to find alternative floral resources. Despite compositional changes, however, network structural properties remained stable after R. ponticum flowering ceased: generality increased, but quantitative connectance, interaction evenness, vulnerability, H’2 and network size did not change. This is likely because after R. ponticum flowering, two to three alternative plant species became prominent in networks and insects increased their diet breadth, as indicated by the increase in network-level generality. We conclude that network structure is robust to seasonal changes in floral abundance at sites invaded by alien, mass-flowering plant species, as long as alternative floral resources remain throughout the season to support the flower-visiting community.},

Previous studies considering such robustness have focused mostly on species’ connectivity properties, particularly their degree. We hypothesized that species’ phenological attributes are at least as important as degree as determinants of network robustness. To test this, we combined dynamic modeling, computer simulation and analysis of data from 12 plant–pollinator networks with detailed information of topology of interactions as well as species’ phenology of plant flowering and pollinator emergence. We found that phenological attributes are strong determinants of network robustness, a result consistent across the networks studied. Plant species persistence was most sensitive to increased larval mortality of pollinators that start earlier or finish later in the season. Pollinator persistence was especially sensitive to decreased visitation rates and increased larval mortality of specialists. Our findings suggest that seasonality of climatic events and anthropic impacts such as the release of pollutants is critical for the future integrity of terrestrial biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The relationship between flowering phenology and abundance of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) was investigated using 2 years of phenological data collected in an alpine region of northern Japan. Abundance of Bombus species was observed along a fixed transect throughout the flowering season. The number of flowering species was closely related to the floral resources for pollinators at the community scale. In the year with typical weather, the first flowering peak corresponded to the emergence time of queen bees from hibernation, while the second flowering peak corresponded to the active period of worker bees. In the year with an unusually warm spring, however, phenological synchrony between plants and bees was disrupted. Estimated emergence of queen bees was 10 days earlier than the first flowering date owing to earlier soil thawing and warming. However, subsequent worker emergence was delayed, indicating slower colony development. The flowering season finished 2 weeks earlier in the warm-spring year in response to earlier snowmelt. A common resident species in the alpine environment, B. hypocrita sapporoensis, flexibly responded to the yearly fluctuation of flowering. In contrast, population dynamics of other Bombus species were out of synchrony with the flowering: their frequencies were highest at the end of the flowering season in the warm-spring year. Therefore, phenological mismatch between flowers and pollinators is evident during warm years, which may become more prevalent in a warmer climate. To understand the mechanism of phenological mismatch in the pollination system of the alpine ecosystem, ground temperature, snowmelt regime, and life cycle of pollinators are key factors.},

	abstract = {This review discusses the prevalence and potential for interactive effects between herbivory and competition on plant growth and biomass, and it is apparent that such effects typically arise when there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of herbivore behaviour (food or patch choice) and the spatial heterogeneity of the plant community. Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence of a biased choice of study systems, where studies using the first approach have primarily studied mammalian herbivory while studies using the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory. Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very small-scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of removal experiments.},

Although recently resurrected as an organizing force in arthropod communities on plants, there is still general agreement that resource competition among herbivores is reduced by predators. Here we show the reverse: predators induce interspecific resource competi-tion among herbivores. We found that thrips larvae (Frankliniella occidentalis) use the web produced and inhabited by the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a refuge from predation by the phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus cucumeris. Thrips larvae prefer clean plant parts, but move into the web upon perceiving volatile cues associated with thrips and predators. This behaviour leads to lower predation risk, but also to reduced developmental rate and lower production of thrips larvae due to competition with spider mites. In addition, thrips larvae consume spider-mite eggs. Thus, predators induce interspecific competition and intraguild predation among herbivores within refuge space, even when host plants have an overall green appearance.},

Recent advancements, however, in our understanding of indirect (plant- and enemy-mediated) interactions challenge the historical paradigms of competition. Thus, in the context of this rapidly developing field, we re-evaluate the evidence for interspecific competition in phytophagous insects using a meta-analysis of published studies. Our analysis is specifically designed to test the assumptions underlying traditional competition theory, namely that competitive interactions are symmetrical, necessitate spatial and temporal co-occurrence, and increase in intensity as the density, phylogenetic similarity, and niche overlap of competing species increase. Despite finding frequent evidence for competition, we found very little evidence that plant-feeding insects conform to theoretical predictions for interspecific competition. Interactions were highly asymmetrical, similar in magnitude within vs. between feeding guilds (chewers vs. sap-feeders), and were unaffected by the quantity of resources removed (\% defoliation). There was mixed support for the effects of phylogeny, spatial/temporal separation, and the relative strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition. Clearly, a new paradigm that accounts for indirect interactions and facilitation is required to describe how interspecific competition contributes to the organization of phytophagous insect communities, and perhaps to other plant and animal communities as well.},

	abstract = {The role of competition in structuring communities of herbivorous insects is still debated. Despite this, few studies have simultaneously investigated the strength of various forms of competition and their effect on community composition. In this study, we examine the extent to which different types of competition will affect the presence and abundance of individual leaf miner species in local communities on oak trees Quercus robur. We first use a laboratory experiment to quantify the strength of intra- and interspecific competition. We then conduct a large-scale field experiment to determine whether competition occurring in one year extends to the next. Finally, we use observational field data to examine the extent to which mechanisms of competition uncovered in the two experiments actually reflect into patterns of co-occurrence in nature. In our experiment, we found direct competition at the leaf-level to be stronger among conspecific than among heterospecific individuals. Indirect competition among conspecifics lowered the survival and weight of larvae of T. ekebladella, both at the branch and the tree-level. In contrast, indirect competition among heterospecifics was only detected in one out of three species pairs examined. In the field experiment, the presence of a given moth species in one year affected the relative abundance of leaf miner species in the next year. Nevertheless, patterns of competition observed in these experiments did not translate into repulsion among free-ranging leaf miners: conspecific larvae of four leaf-mining species were aggregated on the same trees, shoots and leaves. In contrast, heterospecific larvae were only aggregated at the tree-level. We propose that despite the fact that leaf miners do compete and that such effects extend through time, the incidence and strength of competition is relatively small at realistic densities. Hence, competition will likely be of minor importance in shaping the distribution of leaf miners in a natural setting.},

The effect of the invasive herb Oxalis pes-caprae on pollinator visits to the native herb Diplotaxis erucoides was studied when the invader was (1) totally present, (2) present on a large scale (of hectares) but absent on a small scale (of square metres), and (3) totally absent. No difference in number of pollinator visits to D. erucoides was found between treatment 1 and 3, i.e., between total presence and total absence of the invader. However, when the invader was removed in the small scale while still remaining in the large scale, a higher number of visits to the native was recorded. Our study thus shows the importance of incorporating multiple spatial scales to allow for investigation of hierarchical effects on competition for pollinators, and it suggests that small-scale studies of effects of invasive plants on pollinator visitation might risk overstating negative effects of the invader.

	abstract = {Testing restoration methods is essential for the development of restoration ecology as a science. It is also important to monitor a range of taxa, not just plants which have been the traditional focus of restoration ecology. Here, we compare the effects on ground flora and leaf-miners, of two restoration practices used when restoring conifer plantations. Two methods of restoration were investigated: clearfelling of plantations and the gradual thinning of conifers over time. Unrestored plantations and native broadleaved woodlands were also surveyed, these representing the starting point of restoration and the reference community, respectively. The study sites consist of two forest types (acidic Quercus woodland and mesotrophic Fraxinus woodland) enabling us to compare the two restoration methods in different habitat types. We use a well-replicated, large-scale study system consisting of 32 woodland plots, each 2 ha in size. There were 179 plant species identified in the plots. Clearfelled plots had greater overall ground flora species richness than other management regimes (thinned, unrestored plantation and native woodland), but the richness of woodland plant species did not differ between clearfelled, thinned, native woodland and unrestored plantation plots. More than 10 000 leaf-miners comprising 122 species were collected. Increased plant species richness was associated with increased leaf-miner species richness under all management regimes except clearfelled plots. Forest type did not affect the response to restoration method; that is, there was no interaction between management regime and forest type for any of the variables measured. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both the clearfelling and gradual thinning approaches to plantation restoration maintain woodland ground flora species. Either method can be used without detriment to woodland ground flora species richness. However, these methods differed in their effects on the leaf-miner–plant species richness relationship. If increasing invertebrate herbivore species richness is a concern, the gradual thinning approach is more appropriate.},

However, there is very little information about how functionally specialized plants and pollinators interact directly and indirectly in pollination networks. We have developed a parameter, Functional specialization index, to quantify functional specialization in pollination networks. Using this parameter, we examined whether different sized hummingbirds visit a distinct set of flowers in five hummingbird-pollinated plant assemblages from the Lesser Antilles, obtaining a simple relationship between hummingbird body size, network parameter and ecological function. In the Lesser Antilles, functionally specialized hummingbird pollination is distinct for plant species pollinated by the largest hummingbird species, whereas the pollination niche gradually integrates with the insect pollinator community as hummingbird body size decreases. The network approach applied in this study can be used to validate functional specialization and community-level interdependence between plants and pollinators, and it is therefore useful for evaluating and predicting plant resilience to pollinator loss, presently a global concern.},

Because species are embedded in species-rich systems characterized by multiple interactions, it is often hard to identify which species are really important for ecological processes such as pollination. Here we show that species-rich networks describing plant-pollinator interactions share a property with networks depicting social relationships, the friendship paradox, which allows identifying highly-connected species without detailed information on the whole network of interactions. Numerical simulations support that the identified species are those more likely to affect community structure and ecological dynamics. A sampling protocol taking into account the friendship paradox property could be adapted to field studies, helping in the search for conservation surrogates or to monitor changes in the communities, such as functional extinction or the increase in ecological importance of invasive species. We hypothesize that the friendship paradox is likely to arise in networks describing other types of ecological interactions. Besides being useful for conservation and ecosystem management, the friendship paradox may have relevant implications in other areas of biology as well.},

Local coevolution can then be further altered through spatial processes that have been formally partitioned in the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. A major current challenge is to understand the spatial patterns of coadaptation that emerge across ecosystems through the interplay between gene flow and selection in networks of interacting species. Here, we combine a coevolutionary model, network theory, and empirical information on species interactions to investigate how gene flow and geographical variation in selection affect trait patterns in mutualistic networks. We show that gene flow has the surprising effect of favoring trait matching, especially among generalist species in species-rich networks typical of pollination and seed dispersal interactions. Using an analytical approximation of our model, we demonstrate that gene flow promotes trait matching by making the adaptive landscapes of different species more similar to each other. We use this result to show that the progressive loss of gene flow associated with habitat fragmentation may undermine coadaptation in mutualisms. Our results therefore provide predictions of how spatial processes shape the evolution of species-rich interactions and how the widespread fragmentation of natural landscapes may modify the coevolutionary process.},

Our results suggest that the network is more robust when species are eliminated based on their evolutionary uniqueness, followed by random extinctions, the extinction of the most specialist species, functional distinctiveness and, at last, when the most generalist species are sequentially eliminated. Our results provide important information for grassland–forest mosaic management, as they indicate that loss of generalist species and functional diversity makes the system more likely to collapse.},

	abstract = {Ecological interactions shape and are shaped by the evolution of interacting species. Mathematical models and empirical work have explored the multiple ways coevolution could occur in small sets of species, revealing that the addition of even one species can change the coevolutionary dynamics of a pairwise interaction. As a consequence, one of the current challenges in evolutionary biology is to understand how species-rich assemblages evolve and coevolve as networks of interacting species. We combined an adaptive network framework, a trait evolutionary model, and data on network structure to study how network organization affects and is affected by selection in antagonistic interactions such as parasitism, predation, and herbivory. We explored how selection imposed by interactions shapes the evolution of attack and defense traits, parameterizing our models with structural information from 31 empirical assemblages of antagonistic species. In the simulations, the form of coevolution in antagonistic interactions is affected by the intensity and asymmetry of the selection imposed by the interacting partners. Transient escalation in attack and defensive traits was the most prevalent form of coevolutionary dynamics, especially in networks formed by modules of highly interacting species. Fluctuating evolution of traits was observed when the intensity of selection was higher in exploiters than in victims and was especially favored in nested networks. At the species level, highly connected species experienced higher temporal variation in selection regardless of the network structure, resulting in high trait mismatching with their partners. The mismatched patterns of highly connected species, in turn, may explain the emergence of modularity in antagonistic interactions in which selection is stronger on exploiters than on their victims. Our results highlight the roles of different aspects of network structure on antagonistic coevolution: nestedness shapes coevolutionary dynamics, whereas modularity emerges as one outcome of coevolutionary dynamics.},

Restored habitats may serve as “hotspots” for EED due to mismatches between transplanted genotypes and the restored environment, and novel interactions among lineages that do not share a coevolutionary history, both of which can generate strong selection for rapid evolutionary change that has immediate demographic consequences. Rapid evolution that influences population dynamics and community processes is likely to have particularly large effects during the establishment phase of restoration efforts. Finally, restoration activities and their associated long-term monitoring programs provide outstanding opportunities for using eco-evolutionary experimental approaches.

	abstract = {A central current debate in community ecology concerns the relative importance of deterministic versus stochastic processes underlying community structure. However, the concept of stochasticity presents several profound philosophical, theoretical and empirical challenges, which we address here. The philosophical argument that nothing in nature is truly stochastic can be met with the following operational concept of neutral stochasticity in community ecology: change in the composition of a community (i.e. community dynamics) is neutrally stochastic to the degree that individual demographic events – birth, death, immigration, emigration – which cause such changes occur at random with respect to species identities. Empirical methods for identifying the stochastic component of community dynamics or structure include null models and multivariate statistics on observational species-by-site data (with or without environmental or trait data), and experimental manipulations of ‘stochastic’ species colonization order or relative densities and frequencies of competing species. We identify the fundamental limitations of each method with respect to its ability to allow inferences about stochastic community processes. Critical future needs include greater precision in articulating the link between results and ecological inferences, a comprehensive theoretical assessment of the interpretation of statistical analyses of observational data, and experiments focusing on community size and on natural variation in species colonization order. Synthesis Community structure and dynamics have often been described as being underlain by ‘stochastic’ or ‘neutral’ processes, but there is great confusion as to what exactly this means. We attempt to provide conceptual clarity by specifying precisely what focal ecological variable (e.g. species distributions, community composition, demography) is considered to be stochastic with respect to what other variables (e.g. other species' distributions, traits, environment) when using different empirical methods. We clarify what inferences can be drawn by different observational and experimental approaches, and we suggest future avenues of research to better understand the role of neutral stochasticity in community ecology.},

	abstract = {Background
As global environmental change accelerates, biodiversity losses can disrupt interspecific interactions. Extinctions of mutualist partners can create “widow” species, which may face reduced ecological fitness. Hypothetically, such mutualism disruptions could have cascading effects on biodiversity by causing additional species coextinctions. However, the scope of this problem – the magnitude of biodiversity that may lose mutualist partners and the consequences of these losses – remains unknown.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We conducted a systematic review and synthesis of data from a broad range of sources to estimate the threat posed by vertebrate extinctions to the global biodiversity of vertebrate-dispersed and -pollinated plants. Though enormous research gaps persist, our analysis identified Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and global oceanic islands as geographic regions at particular risk of disruption of these mutualisms; within these regions, percentages of plant species likely affected range from 2.1–4.5\%. Widowed plants are likely to experience reproductive declines of 40–58\%, potentially threatening their persistence in the context of other global change stresses.

Conclusions
Our systematic approach demonstrates that thousands of species may be impacted by disruption in one class of mutualisms, but extinctions will likely disrupt other mutualisms, as well. Although uncertainty is high, there is evidence that mutualism disruption directly threatens significant biodiversity in some geographic regions. Conservation measures with explicit focus on mutualistic functions could be necessary to bolster populations of widowed species and maintain ecosystem functions.},

	abstract = {Simulation models are widely used to represent the dynamics of ecological systems. A common question with such models is how changes to a parameter value or functional form in the model alter the results. Some authors have chosen to answer that question using frequentist statistical hypothesis tests (e.g. ANOVA). This is inappropriate for two reasons. First, p-values are determined by statistical power (i.e. replication), which can be arbitrarily high in a simulation context, producing minuscule p-values regardless of the effect size. Second, the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments (e.g. parameter values) is known a priori to be false, invalidating the premise of the test. Use of p-values is troublesome (rather than simply irrelevant) because small p-values lend a false sense of importance to observed differences. We argue that modelers should abandon this practice and focus on evaluating the magnitude of differences between simulations. Synthesis Researchers analyzing field or lab data often test ecological hypotheses using frequentist statistics (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.) that focus on p-values. Field and lab data usually have limited sample sizes, and p-values are valuable for quantifying the probability of making incorrect inferences in that situation. However, modern ecologists increasingly rely on simulation models to address complex questions, and those who were trained in frequentist statistics often apply the hypothesis-testing approach inappropriately to their simulation results. Our paper explains why p-values are not informative for interpreting simulation models, and suggests better ways to evaluate the ecological significance of model results.},

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.},

	abstract = {By using structural characteristics, such as long tubular flowers, plants are known to achieve selective visitation by certain pollinator species. These morphological traits typically arise over evolutionary timescales. We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that at least one plant has also evolved the capacity to recognize pollinator species immediately after visitation, thereby increasing the likelihood that a flower visitor has delivered high-quality pollen. This novel responsiveness by the plant leads to functional specialization in an apparently generalized tropical plant–pollinator network. Such specialized linkages likely facilitate coevolution but also, render pollination mutualisms more vulnerable to environmental change., Understanding the mechanisms enabling coevolution in complex mutualistic networks remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that a tropical plant species has the capacity to discriminate among floral visitors, investing in reproduction differentially across the pollinator community. After we standardized pollen quality in 223 aviary experiments, successful pollination of Heliconia tortuosa (measured as pollen tube abundance) occurred frequently when plants were visited by long-distance traplining hummingbird species with specialized bills (x¯ pollen tubes = 1.21 ± 0.12 SE) but was reduced 5.7 times when visited by straight-billed territorial birds (x¯ pollen tubes = 0.20 ± 0.074 SE) or insects. Our subsequent experiments revealed that plants use the nectar extraction capacity of tropical hummingbirds, a positive function of bill length, as a cue to turn on reproductively. Furthermore, we show that hummingbirds with long bills and high nectar extraction efficiency engaged in daily movements at broad spatial scales (∼1 km), but that territorial species moved only short distances ({\textless}100 m). Such pollinator recognition may therefore affect mate selection and maximize receipt of high-quality pollen from multiple parents. Although a diffuse pollinator network is implied, because all six species of hummingbirds carry pollen of H. tortuosa, only two species with specialized bills contribute meaningfully to its reproduction. We hypothesize that this pollinator filtering behavior constitutes a crucial mechanism facilitating coevolution in multispecies plant–pollinator networks. However, pollinator recognition also greatly reduces the number of realized pollinators, thereby rendering mutualistic networks more vulnerable to environmental change.},

Because individual plants are unable to relocate, they are subject to extreme selection by the insects feeding upon them. One means by which plants suppress herbivory is to produce toxic compounds to deter feeding (see the Perspective by Hare). Agrawal et al. (p. 113) compared pesticide–treated or untreated evening primroses. Over 5 years of pesticide treatment, the production of defensive chemicals in the fruit reduced and flowering times shifted, and the primrose's competitive ability against dandelions improved. Züst et al. (p. 116) examined large-scale geographic patterns in a polymorphic chemical defense locus in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and found that it is matched by changes in the relative abundance of two specialist aphids. Thus, herbivory has strong and immediate effects on the local genotypic composition of plants and traits associated with herbivore resistance.
Insect herbivores are hypothesized to be major factors affecting the ecology and evolution of plants. We tested this prediction by suppressing insects in replicated field populations of a native plant, Oenothera biennis, which reduced seed predation, altered interspecific competitive dynamics, and resulted in rapid evolutionary divergence. Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.

However, the roles of individual parasite species, such as their importance as connectors within the network, and what factors determine these roles, are yet to be investigated. Here, we test the hypotheses that the species roles of trematode, cestode and nematode parasites in aquatic food webs are influenced by the type of definitive host they use, and also determined by their phylogenetic affiliations. We quantified the network role of 189 helminth species from six highly resolved intertidal food webs. We focused on four measures of centrality (node degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvalue centrality), which characterize each parasite's position within the web, and on relative connectedness of a parasite species to taxa in its own module vs. other modules of the web (within-module degree and participation coefficient). All six food webs displayed a significant modular structure, that is, they consisted of subsets of species interacting mostly with each other and less with species from other subsets. We demonstrated that the parasites themselves are not generating this modularity, though they contribute to intermodule connectivity. Mixed-effects models revealed only a modest influence of the type of definitive host used (bird or fish) and of the web of origin on the different measures of parasite species roles. In contrast, the taxonomic affiliations of the parasites, included in the models as nested random factors, accounted for 37–93\% of the total variance, depending on the measure of species role. Our findings indicate that parasites are important intermodule connectors and thus contribute to web cohesion. We also uncover a very strong phylogenetic signal in parasite species roles, suggesting that the role of any parasite species in a food web, including new invasive species, is to some extent predictable based solely on its taxonomic affiliations.},

	abstract = {Studies investigating how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning increasingly focus on multiple functions measured simultaneously (“multifunctionality”). However, few such studies assess the role of species interactions, particularly under alternative environmental scenarios, despite interactions being key to ecosystem functioning. Here we address five questions of central importance to ecosystem multifunctionality using a terrestrial animal system. (1) Does the contribution of individual species differ for different ecosystem functions? (2) Do inter-species interactions affect the delivery of single functions and multiple functions? (3) Does the community composition that maximizes individual functions also maximize multifunctionality? (4) Is the functional role of individual species, and the effect of interspecific interactions, modified by changing environmental conditions? (5) How do these roles and interactions change under varying scenarios where ecosystem services are weighted to reflect different societal preferences? We manipulated species’ relative abundance in dung beetle communities and measured 16 functions contributing to dung decomposition, plant productivity, nutrient recycling, reduction of greenhouse gases, and microbial activity. Using the multivariate diversity–interactions framework, we assessed how changes in species identity, composition, and interspecific interactions affected these functions in combination with an environmental driver (increased precipitation). This allowed us to identify key species and interactions across multiple functions. We then developed a desirability function approach to examine how individual species and species mixtures contribute to a desired state of overall ecosystem functioning. Species contributed unequally to individual functions, and to multifunctionality, and individual functions were maximized by different community compositions. Moreover, the species and interactions important for maintaining overall multifunctionality depended on the weight given to individual functions. Optimal multifunctionality was context-dependent, and sensitive to the valuation of services. This combination of methodological approaches allowed us to resolve the interactions and indirect effects among species that drive ecosystem functioning, revealing how multiple aspects of biodiversity can simultaneously drive ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the importance of a multifunctionality perspective for a complete assessment of species’ functional contributions.},

However, most such studies have been simulation-based analyses of the effect of primary extinction on food web structure. In a field experiment we tested the direct and indirect effects of reducing the abundance of a common species, focusing on the diverse and self-contained assemblage of arthropods associated with an abundant Brazilian shrub, Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. (Asteraceae). Over a 5-month period we experimentally reduced the abundance of Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Sternorrhyncha: Psyllidae), the commonest galling species associated with B. dracunculifolia, in 15 replicate plots paired with 15 control plots. We investigated direct effects of the manipulation on parasitoids attacking B. dracunculifoliae, as well as indirect effects (mediated via a third species or through the environment) on 10 other galler species and 50 associated parasitoid species. The experimental manipulation significantly increased parasitism on B. dracunculifoliae in the treatment plots, but did not significantly alter either the species richness or abundance of other galler species. Compared to control plots, food webs in manipulated plots had significantly lower values of weighted connectance, interaction evenness and robustness (measured as simulated tolerance to secondary extinction), even when B. dracunculifoliae was excluded from calculations. Parasitoid species were almost entirely specialized to individual galler species, so the observed effects of the manipulation on food web structure could not have propagated via the documented trophic links. Instead, they must have spread either through trophic links not included in the webs (e.g. shared predators) or non-trophically (e.g. through changes in habitat availability). Our results highlight that the inclusion of both trophic and non-trophic direct and indirect interactions is essential to understand the structure and dynamics of even apparently discrete ecological communities.},

A functional trait framework has been proposed to improve the mechanistic understanding of this relationship, but this has rarely been tested for organisms other than plants. We analysed eight datasets, including five animal groups, to examine how well a trait-based approach, compared with a more traditional taxonomic approach, predicts seven ecosystem functions below- and above-ground. Trait-based indices consistently provided greater explanatory power than species richness or abundance. The frequency distributions of single or multiple traits in the community were the best predictors of ecosystem functioning. This implies that the ecosystem functions we investigated were underpinned by the combination of trait identities (i.e. single-trait indices) and trait complementarity (i.e. multi-trait indices) in the communities. Our study provides new insights into the general mechanisms that link biodiversity to ecosystem functioning in natural animal communities and suggests that the observed responses were due to the identity and dominance patterns of the trait composition rather than the number or abundance of species per se.},

One of the main goals of ecological restoration is the recovery of ecosystem function, yet most researchers assume that increasing species and or functional diversity equates with restoration of ecosystem function, rather than empirically demonstrating these mechanistic relationships. In this study, we assess how dung beetle species diversity, community composition, functional diversity and ecological functions vary along a restoration chronosequence and compare restored areas with reference (rain forest) and degraded (pasture) systems. We also directly investigate the dung beetle diversity – ecosystem functioning relationship in the context of ecological rain forest restoration by testing the predictive power of traditional taxonomic indices and functional diversity metrics for functionality. Species richness, abundance, biomass and functional richness all increased with restoration age, with the oldest restoration sites being most similar to rain forest, whereas functional evenness and functional divergence decreased with restoration age. Community composition in the restored areas was clearly progressing towards the rain forest sites and deviating from the pasture sites with increasing restoration age. Secondary seed dispersal rates increased with restoration age, but there was only a weak positive relationship between dung removal and soil excavation and restoration age. Biodiversity metrics explained 47–74\% of the variation in functions mediated by dung beetles; however, functional trait-based indices provided greater explanatory power of functionality than traditional species-based metrics. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide empirical evidence on the potential of tropical forest restoration to mitigate biodiversity losses, recovering not only faunal species diversity, but also functional diversity and ecosystem functions in a relatively short period of time. We also demonstrate that functional trait-based metrics are better predictors of functionality than traditional species-based metrics but that the relationship between restoration age, diversity and ecosystem functioning is not straightforward and depends on the functions, traits and metrics used.},

	abstract = {Agriculture's influence on humanity is a dichotomy of promise and peril. Research on the food-environment dilemma has highlighted the environmental consequences of food production, yet the identification of management solutions is an ongoing challenge. We suggest “bright spots” as a promising tool to identify levers of change by finding areas that exceed expectations for goals, such as agricultural landscape multifunctionality and biodiversity. We identified bright, dark and average spots within a complex agricultural landscape and explored the associated socioeconomic patterns. We found that areas exceeding expectations for biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality were neither spatially congruent nor in conflict. It was more common for areas to underperform (dark spots) for both biodiversity and multifunctionality than over perform for both (bright spots). While dark spots for multifunctionality were alike in their ecosystem service composition, bright spots were bright in multiple, diverse ways. The socioeconomic attributes that characterize bright and darks spots included both farm characteristics as well as farming practices, suggesting that both have potential to be levers of change. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that while biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality show similar spatial patterns due to underlying biophysical drivers, managing for biodiversity or landscape multifunctionality alone will not implicitly achieve the other in this system. Bright spots (areas exceeding expectations) in multifunctionality were associated with many different combinations of ecosystem services, but dark spots were uniquely agricultural intensive areas devoted to maximizing crop production at the expense of all other services. From a management perspective, specific farm characteristics and farming practices may impact the potential for multifunctionality: increased mechanization, increased agricultural inputs and larger farm size and capital were associated with dark spots, while smaller farms with potentially greater space for innovation were associated with bright spots.},

	abstract = {The boreal biome, representing approximately one-third of remaining global forests, provides a number of crucial ecosystem services. A particular challenge in forest ecosystems is to reconcile demand for an increased timber production with provisioning of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. However, there is still little knowledge about how forest management could help solve this challenge. Hence, studies that investigate how to manage forests to reduce trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity are urgently needed to help forest owners and policy makers take informed decisions. We applied seven alternative forest management regimes using a forest growth simulator in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimated the potential of the landscape to provide harvest revenues, store carbon and maintain biodiversity across a 50-year time period. Then, we applied multiobjective optimization to identify the trade-offs between these three objectives and to identify the optimal combination of forest management regimes to achieve these objectives. It was not possible to achieve high levels of either carbon storage or biodiversity if the objective of forest management was to maximize timber harvest revenues. Moreover, conflicts between biodiversity and carbon storage became stronger when simultaneously targeting high levels of timber revenues. However, with small reductions in timber revenues, it was possible to greatly increase the multifunctionality of the landscape, especially the biodiversity indicators. Forest management actions, alternative to business-as-usual management, such as reducing thinnings, extending the rotation period and increasing the amount of area set aside from forestry may be necessary to safeguard biodiversity and non-timber ecosystem services in Fennoscandia.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that no forest management regime alone is able to maximize timber revenues, carbon storage and biodiversity individually or simultaneously and that a combination of different regimes is needed to resolve the conflicts among these objectives. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the trade-offs between different objectives by applying diversified forest management planning at the boreal landscape level and that we need to give up the all-encompassing objective of very intensive timber production, which is prevailing particularly in Fennoscandian countries.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest landscapes face competing demands for conserving biodiversity, sustaining ecosystem services and accommodating production systems such as forestry and agriculture. Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes. Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets. All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29–37\% to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation. Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29–37\% of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict.},

However, most evidence comes from small-scale studies, and scaling-up patterns of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (B-EF) remains challenging, in part because the importance of environmental factors in shaping B-EF relations is poorly understood. Using a forest research platform in which 26 ecosystem functions were measured along gradients of tree species richness in six regions across Europe, we investigated the extent and the potential drivers of context dependency of B-EF relations. Despite considerable variation in species richness effects across the continent, we found a tendency for stronger B-EF relations in drier climates as well as in areas with longer growing seasons and more functionally diverse tree species. The importance of water availability in driving context dependency suggests that as water limitation increases under climate change, biodiversity may become even more important to support high levels of functioning in European forests.},

There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses. This review also serves as the introduction to this special issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on various aspects of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

However, surprisingly little is known about the role that forest fragments play in the provision of ecosystem services and how fragmentation affects landscape multifunctionality at scales relevant to land management decisions. We measured the provision of six ecosystem services (crop production, pest regulation, decomposition, carbon storage, soil fertility and water quality regulation) in soya bean fields at different distances from adjacent forest fragments that differed in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada. We observed significant effects of distance-from-forest, fragment isolation and fragment size on crop production, insect pest regulation, and decomposition. Distance-from-forest and fragment isolation had unique influences on service provision for each of the ecosystem services we measured. For example, pest regulation was maximized adjacent to forest fragments, while crop production was maximized at intermediate distances-from-forest. As a consequence, landscape multifunctionality depended on landscape heterogeneity: the range of field and forest fragment types present. We also observed strong negative and positive relationships between ecosystem services that were more prevalent at greater distances-from-forest. Synthesis and applications. Our study is one of the first to empirically measure and model the effects of forest fragments on the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem services in an agro-ecosystem at the landscape and field scales relevant to landowners and managers. Our results demonstrate that forest fragments, irrespective of their size, can affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services in surrounding fields, but that this effect is mediated by fragment isolation across the landscape. Our results also suggest that managing habitat fragmentation and landscape structure will improve our ability to optimize ecosystem service provision and create multifunctional agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Large-scale deforestation has led to drastic alterations of landscapes worldwide, with serious declines of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, leading to impacts on humanity ranging from the local to the global scale. However, the provision of crucial ecosystem functions is not only determined by the extent, but also by the spatial configuration of forests within the landscape mosaic. An approach that aims to restore forest functions on a landscape scale is Forest Landscape Restoration, with the purpose to regain ecological integrity and support human well-being. The landscape-scale approach should enhance the contribution of site-based restoration to larger-scale processes and functional synergies. A fundamental challenge for Forest Landscape Restoration is therefore the identification of restoration areas within the landscape where multiple functions operating on different scales can be enhanced. Equally important is the task of identifying areas requiring restoration. Proposed strategies include the assessment of current, past, and reference landscape states. However, integrative planning approaches combining historical and functional perspectives on a landscape scale are little developed. In this paper, we demonstrate how forest restoration areas can be identified that account for historical forest patterns while simultaneously targeting multiple forest functions. We use a method developed for habitat suitability modeling based on recent historical forest occurrence and regeneration patterns from 1985 to 2008 in order to predict areas that are suitable for forest restoration (potential forest growth) as well as areas where forest potentially recovers by natural regeneration. For both, unsuitable areas are excluded by masking restoration constraints. Separately, we map potential forest functions and assess spatial synergies or ?multifunctional hotspots? using spatial multi-criteria analysis. To derive a scenario of potential restoration areas, predicted maps of restoration suitability and regeneration potential are separately combined with a map depicting the degree of multifunctionality. These maps are finally overlapped to identify multifunctional restoration and regeneration areas. These designated areas are then evaluated regarding their distribution on current land cover and recent historical deforestation areas. We test this approach for the dry forest landscape in Central Chile, an international biodiversity hotspot, which has undergone profound historical transformations and considerable deforestation in recent decades.},

We used a comprehensive pan-European dataset, including 16 ecosystem functions measured in 209 forest plots across six European countries, and performed simulations to investigate how local plot-scale richness of tree species (α-diversity) and their turnover between plots (β-diversity) are related to landscape-scale multifunctionality. After accounting for variation in environmental conditions, we found that relationships between α-diversity and landscape-scale multifunctionality varied from positive to negative depending on the multifunctionality metric used. In contrast, when significant, relationships between β-diversity and landscape-scale multifunctionality were always positive, because a high spatial turnover in species composition was closely related to a high spatial turnover in functions that were supported at high levels. Our findings have major implications for forest management and indicate that biotic homogenization can have previously unrecognized and negative consequences for large-scale ecosystem multifunctionality.},

Although the feedback loop between population dynamics and coevolution of traits is crucial for understanding long-term stability in ecological assemblages, modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics in species-rich assemblages is still a challenge. We explore how eco-evolutionary feedbacks influence trait evolution and species abundances in 23 empirical antagonistic networks. We show that, if selection due to antagonistic interactions is stronger than other selective pressures, eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to higher mean species abundances and lower temporal variation in abundances. By contrast, strong selection of antagonistic interactions leads to higher temporal variation of traits and on interaction strengths. Our results present a theoretical link between the study of the species persistence and coevolution in networks of interacting species, pointing out the ways by which coevolution may decrease the vulnerability of species within antagonistic networks to demographic fluctuation.},

	abstract = {Climate change presents new challenges for selecting species for restoration. If migration fails to keep pace with climate change, as models predict, the most suitable sources for restoration may not occur locally at all. To address this issue, we propose a strategy of “prestoration”: utilizing species in restoration for which a site represents suitable habitat now and into the future. Using the Colorado Plateau, United States, as a case study, we assess the ability of grass species currently used regionally in restoration to persist into the future using projections of ecological niche models (or climate envelope models) across a suite of climate change scenarios. We then present a technique for identifying new species that best compensate for future losses of suitable habitat by current target species. We found that the current suite of species, selected by a group of experts, is predicted to perform reasonably well in the short term, but that losses of prestorable habitat by mid-century would approach 40\%. Using an algorithm to identify additional species, we found that fewer than 10 species could compensate for nearly all of the losses incurred by the current target species. This case study highlights the utility of integrating ecological niche modeling and future climate forecasts to predict the utility of species in restoring under climate change across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Ecology is often said to lack general theories sufficiently predictive for applications. Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche ‘dimensions’, or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification.},

	abstract = {A group of conservation biologists recently proposed to populate western North America with African and Asian megafauna, including lions, elephants, cheetahs, and camels, to create a facsimile of a species assemblage that disappeared from the continent some 13,000 years ago. The goals of this program, known as “Pleistocene re-wilding”, are to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that was lost from North America during the Pleistocene extinctions, and help prevent the extinction of selected African and Asian mammals. Pleistocene re-wilders justify this conservation strategy on ethical and aesthetic grounds, arguing that humans have a moral responsibility to make amends for overexploitation by our ancestors. They believe that the flora of many North American terrestrial ecosystems has gone basically unchanged since the end of the Pleistocene, so re-wilding would help restore evolutionary and ecological potential and improve ecosystem functioning. This paper discusses some of the pros and cons of this proposal, including the ethical, aesthetic, ecological, and evolutionary issues, assesses its potential economic and political impacts on other conservation practices, both in North America and elsewhere, and reviews the realities of large mammal reintroductions. It is concluded that Pleistocene re-wilding with exotic species will not restore the evolutionary or ecological potential of native North American species nor extinct Pleistocene megafauna and their ancient ecosystems, but may instead jeopardize indigenous species and North American ecosystems. Resources would be better spent on preserving threatened organisms in their native habitats and reintroducing them to places in their historical ranges from which they were only recently extirpated.},

	abstract = {Trophic rewilding is an ecological restoration strategy that uses species introductions to restore top-down trophic interactions and associated trophic cascades to promote self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems. Given the importance of large animals in trophic cascades and their widespread losses and resulting trophic downgrading, it often focuses on restoring functional megafaunas. Trophic rewilding is increasingly being implemented for conservation, but remains controversial. Here, we provide a synthesis of its current scientific basis, highlighting trophic cascades as the key conceptual framework, discussing the main lessons learned from ongoing rewilding projects, systematically reviewing the current literature, and highlighting unintentional rewilding and spontaneous wildlife comebacks as underused sources of information. Together, these lines of evidence show that trophic cascades may be restored via species reintroductions and ecological replacements. It is clear, however, that megafauna effects may be affected by poorly understood trophic complexity effects and interactions with landscape settings, human activities, and other factors. Unfortunately, empirical research on trophic rewilding is still rare, fragmented, and geographically biased, with the literature dominated by essays and opinion pieces. We highlight the need for applied programs to include hypothesis testing and science-based monitoring, and outline priorities for future research, notably assessing the role of trophic complexity, interplay with landscape settings, land use, and climate change, as well as developing the global scope for rewilding and tools to optimize benefits and reduce human–wildlife conflicts. Finally, we recommend developing a decision framework for species selection, building on functional and phylogenetic information and with attention to the potential contribution from synthetic biology.},

We manipulated soil depth (two levels) and nutrient availability (three levels) to create four heterogeneity treatments (no heterogeneity, depth heterogeneity, nutrient heterogeneity, and depth + nutrient heterogeneity) replicated in an agricultural field seeded to native prairie species. Our objective was to determine whether resource heterogeneity influences species diversity and the trajectory of community development during grassland restoration. The treatments significantly increased heterogeneity of available inorganic nitrogen (N), soil water content, and light penetration. Plant diversity was indirectly related to resource heterogeneity through positive relationships with variability in productivity and cover established by the belowground manipulations. Diversity was inversely correlated with the average cover of the dominant grass, Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), which increased over time in all heterogeneity treatments and resulted in community convergence among the heterogeneity treatments over time. The success of this cultivar across the wide range of resource availability was attributed to net photosynthesis rates equivalent to or higher than those of the native prairie plants in the presence of lower foliar N content. Our results suggest that resource heterogeneity alone may not increase diversity in restorations where a dominant species can successfully establish across the range of resource availability. This is consistent with theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly in that the establishment of one species best adapted for the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining community structure.},

	abstract = {1. Stream ecosystems are increasingly impacted by multiple stressors that lead to a loss of sensitive species and an overall reduction in diversity. A dominant paradigm in ecological restoration is that increasing habitat heterogeneity (HH) promotes restoration of biodiversity. This paradigm is reflected in stream restoration projects through the common practice of re-configuring channels to add meanders and adding physical structures such as boulders and artificial riffles to restore biodiversity by enhancing structural heterogeneity. 2. To evaluate the validity of this paradigm, we completed an extensive evaluation of published studies that have quantitatively examined the reach-scale response of invertebrate species richness to restoration actions that increased channel complexity/HH. We also evaluated studies that used manipulative or correlative approaches to test for a relationship between physical heterogeneity and invertebrate diversity in streams that were not in need of restoration. 3. We found habitat and macroinvertebrate data for 78 independent stream or river restoration projects described by 18 different author groups in which invertebrate taxa richness data in response to the restoration treatment were available. Most projects were successful in enhancing physical HH; however, only two showed statistically significant increases in biodiversity rendering them more similar to reference reaches or sites. 4. Studies manipulating structural complexity in otherwise healthy streams were generally small in scale and less than half showed a significant positive relationship with invertebrate diversity. Only one-third of the studies that attempted to correlate biodiversity to existing levels of in-stream heterogeneity found a positive relationship. 5. Across all the studies we evaluated, there is no evidence that HH was the primary factor controlling stream invertebrate diversity, particularly in a restoration context. The findings indicate that physical heterogeneity should not be the driving force in selecting restoration approaches for most degraded waterways. Evidence suggests that much more must be done to restore streams impacted by multiple stressors than simply re-configuring channels and enhancing structural complexity with meanders, boulders, wood, or other structures. 6. Thematic implications: as integrators of all activities on the land, streams are sensitive to a host of stressors including impacts from urbanisation, agriculture, deforestation, invasive species, flow regulation, water extractions and mining. The impacts of these individually or in combination typically lead to a decrease in biodiversity because of reduced water quality, biologically unsuitable flow regimes, dispersal barriers, altered inputs of organic matter or sunlight, degraded habitat, etc. Despite the complexity of these stressors, a large number of stream restoration projects focus primarily on physical channel characteristics. We show that this is not a wise investment if ecological recovery is the goal. Managers should critically diagnose the stressors impacting an impaired stream and invest resources first in repairing those problems most likely to limit restoration.},

	abstract = {1. Habitat offsets are increasingly used in attempts to avoid the impacts of permitted habitat removal on biodiversity, but their ability to achieve a genuine compensatory effect is a matter of debate. Approaches to offsetting typically aim to achieve ‘no net loss’ of habitat over time, yet few evaluations exist of whether this outcome is feasible. 2. We investigated the potential of offsets to mitigate the impacts of habitat removal in the long term using a case study of future scenarios of habitat availability for an endangered bird, the south-eastern red-tailed black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne. Important food resources for this species include scattered large buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii trees which are under threat of removal for agricultural intensification. We projected availability of large buloke trees over a 150-year period, initially using recent rates of decline to inform a ‘business as usual’ scenario, then examining alternative scenarios reflecting different offset strategies. 3. All scenarios suggested that numbers of large trees will continue to decline for at least 100 years. Because of time lags in resource maturation, offsets were unable to achieve no net loss in the medium-term, and the most plausible offset scenarios were inadequate to compensate for habitat loss at year-100, when resource availability was lowest. 4. To minimize the temporal extent and severity of this future resource bottleneck, offsets must include both replanting and protection of other large, at-risk trees, with a high ratio of protected trees to trees cleared. 5. Synthesis and applications. The success of habitat offsets in cases where there is a significant lag between habitat loss and replacement of resources for a threatened species is likely to be low, because resource bottlenecks become a significant threat to the persistence of the species. In order to identify habitat protection options that will genuinely offset habitat removal, it is essential to estimate explicitly the ‘avoided loss’ of habitat attributable to its protection.},

	abstract = {Offsets are a novel conservation tool, yet using them to achieve no net loss of biodiversity is challenging. This is especially true when using conservation offsets (i.e., protected areas) because achieving no net loss requires avoiding equivalent loss. Our objective was to determine if offsetting the impacts of mining achieves no net loss of native vegetation in Brazil's largest iron mining region. We used a land-use change model to simulate deforestation by mining to 2020; developed a model to allocate conservation offsets to the landscape under 3 scenarios (baseline, no new offsets; current practice, like-for-like [by vegetation type] conservation offsetting near the impact site; and threat scenario, like-for-like conservation offsetting of highly threatened vegetation); and simulated nonmining deforestation to 2020 for each scenario to quantify avoided deforestation achieved with offsets. Mines cleared 3570 ha of native vegetation by 2020. Under a 1:4 offset ratio, mining companies would be required to conserve {\textgreater}14,200 ha of native vegetation, doubling the current extent of protected areas in the region. Allocating offsets under current practice avoided deforestation equivalent to 3\% of that caused by mining, whereas allocating under the threat scenario avoided 9\%. Current practice failed to achieve no net loss because offsets did not conserve threatened vegetation. Explicit allocation of offsets to threatened vegetation also failed because the most threatened vegetation was widely dispersed across the landscape, making conservation logistically difficult. To achieve no net loss with conservation offsets requires information on regional deforestation trajectories and the distribution of threatened vegetation. However, in some regions achieving no net loss through conservation may be impossible. In these cases, other offsetting activities, such as revegetation, will be required.

Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.
Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.

Globally, species richness is 10.6\% higher and abundance 14.5\% higher in samples taken inside protected areas compared with samples taken outside, but neither rarefaction-based richness nor endemicity differ significantly. Importantly, we show that the positive effects of protection are mostly attributable to differences in land use between protected and unprotected sites.

	abstract = {Recent studies show that intraspecific genetic variation in asexual species may have large effects on community and ecosystem functions, increasing their stability, productivity, and species richness. However, major questions regarding its population-level impact remain empirically unanswered: (a) How does intraspecific genetic diversity affect the ecological characteristics of sexual species, in which recombination can alter the outcome of causal mechanisms such as selection and niche diversification? (b) Does genetic diversity increase population dynamic stability? (c) Is the impact of genetic diversity dependent on the selective environment? To answer these questions, I founded replicate flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) populations with different degrees of ecologically relevant, heritable trait variation and monitored their dynamics for approximately eight generations. I show that population stability and persistence increased with greater genetic variation but that the stabilizing effect was independent of the selective habitat (different proportions of ancestral and novel resources). Alleles from a single founding strain underwent a selective sweep in the homogeneous ancestral habitat but not in a novel heterogeneous habitat. These results expand current understanding of the ecological impacts of genetic diversity by showing that genetically more diverse sexual populations persist longer and are more stable but that the selective environment determines the mechanistic basis of increased stability.},

The accumulated effects of many individual and household decisions have major negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem health. Human behavioral science blends psychology and economics to understand how people respond to the context in which they make decisions (eg who presents the information and how it is framed). Behavioral insights have informed new strategies to improve personal health and financial choices. However, less is known about whether and how these insights can encourage choices that are better for the environment. We review 160 experimental interventions that attempt to alter behavior in six domains in which decisions have major environmental impacts: family planning, land management, meat consumption, transportation choices, waste production, and water use. The evidence suggests that social influence and simple adjustments to decision settings can influence pro-environmental decisions. We identify four important gaps in the evidence that provide opportunities for future research. To address these gaps, we encourage collaborations between researchers and practitioners that look at the effects of embedding tests of behavior-change interventions within environmental programs.},

Behavioral sciences have informed policy in many other realms (e.g., health, savings), but they are a largely untapped resource for conservation. We propose a set of guiding questions for applying behavioral insights to conservation policy. These questions help define the conservation problem as a behavior change problem, understand behavioral mechanisms and identify appropriate approaches for behavior change (awareness, incentives, nudges), and evaluate and adapt approaches based on new behavioral insights. We provide a foundation for the questions by synthesizing a wide range of behavior change models and evidence related to littering, water and energy conservation, and land management. We also discuss the methodology and data needed to answer these questions. We illustrate how these questions have been answered in practice to inform efforts to promote conservation for climate risk reduction. Although more comprehensive research programs to answer these questions are needed, some insights are emerging. Integrating two or more behavior change approaches that target multiple, context-dependent factors may be most successful; however, caution must be taken to avoid approaches that could undermine one another (e.g., economic incentives crowding out intrinsic incentives).},

	abstract = {The high pollen and nectar yield of Asteraceae flowers combined with the abundance and diversity of these plants should make them an important pollen source for both specialist and generalist bees. However, studies have found Asteraceae pollen to be a poor diet for some generalist bees, possibly owing to nutrient deficiencies or the presence of secondary metabolites or digestive barriers that prevent nutrient assimilation. Mixing pollens could allow bees to exploit these unfavourable pollens, if the different pollen sources help to complement nutrient deficiencies or alleviate the effects of toxic secondary metabolites. In our study, we examined how the proportion of sunflower (Helianthus annuus, Asteraceae) pollen in the diet of captive-reared bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) affects the survival of bees in queenless microcolonies. Bees fed on sunflower pollen had significantly shorter lifespans than bees fed on broad bean (Vicia faba, Fabaceae), rapeseed (Brassica napus, Brassicaceae) or Cucurbitaceae pollen. However, survival on mixed pollen diets containing 50\% sunflower pollen was as great as that on non-sunflower diets, which suggests that the other pollens were able to compensate for the low nutritive quality of the sunflower pollen. Due to agricultural intensification and a loss of wildflowers, farmland monocultures (e.g. sunflower crops) can be important floral resources for bumblebees. Our study suggests that providing alternative floral resources of high nutritive quality could help mitigate the potential harmful effects of a monofloral sunflower diet on bumblebees.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation promote relatively predicable shifts in the functional signature of tropical forest tree assemblages, but the full extent of cascading effects to biodiversity persistence remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypotheses that habitat fragmentation (a) alters the relative contribution of tree species exhibiting different reproductive traits; (b) reduces the diversity of pollination systems; and (c) facilitates the functional convergence of reproductive traits between edge-affected and early-secondary forest habitats (5–32 years old). This study was carried out in a severely fragmented 670-km2 forest landscape of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil. We assigned 35 categories of reproductive traits to 3552 trees (DBH⩾10cm) belonging to 179 species, which described their pollination system, floral biology, and sexual system. Trait abundance was calculated for 55 plots of 0.1ha across four habitats: forest edges, small forest fragments (3.4–83.6ha), second-growth patches, and core tracts of forest interior within the largest available primary forest fragment (3500ha) in the region. Edge-affected and secondary habitats showed a species-poor assemblage of trees exhibiting particular pollination systems, a reduced diversity of pollination systems, a higher abundance of reproductive traits associated with pollination by generalist diurnal vectors, and an elevated abundance of hermaphroditic trees. As expected, the reproductive signature of tree assemblages in forest edges and small fragments (edge-affected habitats), which was very similar to that of early second-growth patches, was greatly affected by both habitat type and plot distance to the nearest forest edge. In hyper-fragmented Atlantic forest landscapes, we predict that narrow forest corridors and small fragments will become increasingly dominated by edge-affected habitats that can no longer retain the full complement of tree life-history diversity and its attendant mutualists.},

Based on what has been done in this biome, we try to summarize the main findings and challenges for restoration in this highly threatened forest biome. We found that many past experiences did not result in self-perpetuating forests, for different reasons. Currently, most projects aim to construct self-sustaining communities and no longer see restoration as a deterministic process. We also found that the reconstruction of permanent forest with high diversity is feasible but it depends on the strategies applied and on the surrounding landscape. Although many new techniques have been created (e.g. seed rain management or promotion of natural regeneration), the most used one in the Atlantic Forest is still the planting of many native species from different functional groups. Native species are largely used and perform well even in highly disturbed environments. Today, many projects are trying to produce thousands of hectares of permanent forests and many technical advances are about to be incorporated. But restoration also faces some main challenges to become an effective and widespread means of conserving the Atlantic Forest which are, namely, reducing costs, planning restoration actions at landscape-level, and conforming to socio-political issues. The socio-political tools to overcome such barriers in practice have yet to be developed.},

	abstract = {The complex interactions among endangered ecosystems, landowners’ interests, and different models of land tenure and use, constitute an important series of challenges for those seeking to maintain and restore biodiversity and augment the flow of ecosystem services. Over the past 10 years, we have developed a data-based approach to address these challenges and to achieve medium and large-scale ecological restoration of riparian areas on private lands in the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Given varying motivations for ecological restoration, the location of riparian areas within landholdings, environmental zoning of different riparian areas, and best-practice restoration methods were developed for each situation. A total of 32 ongoing projects, covering 527,982ha, were evaluated in large sugarcane farms and small mixed farms, and six different restoration techniques have been developed to help upscale the effort. Small mixed farms had higher portions of land requiring protection as riparian areas (13.3\%), and lower forest cover of riparian areas (18.3\%), than large sugarcane farms (10.0\% and 36.9\%, respectively for riparian areas and forest cover values). In both types of farms, forest fragments required some degree of restoration. Historical anthropogenic degradation has compromised forest ecosystem structure and functioning, despite their high-diversity of native tree and shrub species. Notably, land use patterns in riparian areas differed markedly. Large sugarcane farms had higher portions of riparian areas occupied by highly mechanized agriculture, abandoned fields, and anthropogenic wet fields created by siltation in water courses. In contrast, in small mixed crop farms, low or non-mechanized agriculture and pasturelands were predominant. Despite these differences, plantations of native tree species covering the entire area was by far the main restoration method needed both by large sugarcane farms (76.0\%) and small mixed farms (92.4\%), in view of the low resilience of target sites, reduced forest cover, and high fragmentation, all of which limit the potential for autogenic restoration. We propose that plantations should be carried out with a high-diversity of native species in order to create biologically viable restored forests, and to assist long-term biodiversity persistence at the landscape scale. Finally, we propose strategies to integrate the political, socio-economic and methodological aspects needed to upscale restoration efforts in tropical forest regions throughout Latin America and elsewhere.},

Selected, predominantly American, women ecologists are presented within five time frames according to the date of their PhD, an event marking the beginning of their careers. A general view is given for pre-1900 Protoecologists, followed by brief professional sketches for 10 Early Pioneers (1900–1934), 16 Late Pioneers (1935–1960), and 28 members of the irst Modern Wave (1961–1975). The relatively large number of women who earned doctorates after 1975 precludes discussion of individuals from this time in this review. The following issues are discussed in the context of their research contributions: 1) motivating factors, 2) graduate education and subfield entered, 3) mentors and role models, 4) employment, 5) marriage and family constraints, and 6) recognition. These issues are compared with data from recent surveys for post-1976 women doctorates. Each selected woman still alive was contacted for her assessment of her research; 156 research citations display the significance and range of subjects studied. A steady, albeit slow, progress since 1900 is evident, although some problems regarding gender equality in professional development of women ecologists persist. These issues, however, are now more clearly recognized and addressed.},

Conservation effort would benefit from tools that help forecast the consequences of species removal. One such tool is the dominator tree, a graph-theoretic algorithm that when applied to food webs unfolds their complex architecture, yielding a simpler topology made of linear pathways that are essential for energy delivery. Each species along these chains is responsible for passing energy to the taxa that follow it and, as such, it is indispensable for their survival. To assess the predictive potential of the dominator tree, we compare its predictions with the effects that followed the collapse of the capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Barents Sea ecosystem. To this end, we first compiled a food web for this ecosystem, then we built the corresponding dominator tree and, finally, we observed whether model predictions matched the empirical observations. This analysis shows the potential and the drawbacks of the dominator trees as a tool for understanding the causes and consequences of extinctions in food webs.},

However, several studies show that small errors in estimating the entries of the community matrix translate into large errors in predicting individual species responses. Here, we ask whether there are properties of complex communities one can still predict using only a crude, order-of-magnitude estimate of the community matrix entries. Using empirical data, randomly generated community matrices, and those generated by the Allometric Trophic Network model, we show that the stability and reactivity properties of systems can be predicted with good accuracy. We also provide theoretical insight into when and why our crude approximations are expected to yield an accurate description of communities. Our results indicate that even rough estimates of interaction strengths can be useful for assessing global properties of large systems.},

Our data measure students’ personal characteristics and academic performance, as well as their social network information drawn from 4.5 million email correspondences among hundreds of students who were placed directly into leadership positions. After controlling for students’ personal characteristics, work experience, and academic performance, we find that students’ social networks strongly predict placement into leadership positions. For males, the higher a male student’s centrality in the school-wide network, the higher his leadership-job placement will be. Men with network centrality in the top quartile have an expected job placement level that is 1.5 times greater than men in the bottom quartile of centrality. While centrality also predicts women’s placement, high-placing women students have one thing more: an inner circle of predominantly female contacts who are connected to many nonoverlapping third-party contacts. Women with a network centrality in the top quartile and a female-dominated inner circle have an expected job placement level that is 2.5 times greater than women with low centrality and a male-dominated inner circle. Women who have networks that resemble those of high-placing men are low-placing, despite having leadership qualifications comparable to high-placing women.},

	abstract = {Aim Functional relationships between species groups on macroecological scales have often been inferred from comparisons of species numbers across space. On large spatial scales, however, it is difficult to assess whether correlations of species numbers represent actual functional relationships. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between a feeding guild (fruit-eating birds) and its resource (fleshy-fruited plants) by studying the matching of their functional traits across spatial scales, from individual interactions to regional patterns. Location A 3000-m elevational gradient in the tropical Andes. Methods We sampled plant–bird interactions at two sites along the elevational gradient, and using multivariate statistics (fourth-corner analysis) we identified corresponding morphological traits of birds and plants that influenced which bird species fed from which plant species. We then tested whether the functional trait diversities of the bird species assemblages matched those of the plant species assemblages along the elevational gradient. Results Corresponding functional traits of birds and plants were closely and significantly correlated on the scale of individual plant–bird interactions. On the regional scale, the functional diversities, but not species numbers, of bird and plant assemblages correlated significantly along the elevational gradient. Main conclusions The analysis of species interaction networks with multivariate statistics was a powerful tool for identifying relationships between functional traits of interacting species. The close functional relationships between birds and plants on the scale of individual interactions and on the regional scale show that comparisons of functional trait diversities, based on matching traits of interacting species, are better suited than correlations of species numbers to reveal the mechanisms behind large-scale diversity patterns of interacting species. The identification of functional interdependences between interacting species on large spatial scales will be important for improving predictive models of species distributions in space and time.},

	abstract = {A long-standing question in community ecology is whether food webs are organized in compartments, where species within the same compartment interact frequently among themselves, but show fewer interactions with species from other compartments. Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.},

	abstract = {Aim To investigate the association between hummingbird–plant network structure and species richness, phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern, insularity and historical and current climate. Location Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39° N–32° S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700 m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes. Methods We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant–hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity). Results Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R2 = 0.18–0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R2 = 0.20–0.44 and R2 = 0.32–0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability. Main conclusions Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant–bird mutualistic systems.},

Thus, closely related species usually interact with ecologically similar partners, which can be reinforced by diverse co-evolutionary processes. The effect of habitat fragmentation on the phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions and correspondence between plant and animal phylogenies is, however, unknown. Here, we address to what extent phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic congruence of plant–animal interactions depend on habitat size and isolation by analysing the phylogenetic structure of 12 pollination webs from isolated Pampean hills. Phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions differed among webs, being stronger for flower-visiting insects than plants. Phylogenetic signal and overall co-phylogenetic congruence increased independently with hill size and isolation. We propose that habitat fragmentation would erode the phylogenetic structure of interaction webs. A decrease in phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic correspondence in plant–pollinator interactions could be associated with less reliable mutualism and erratic co-evolutionary change.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that an appropriate model for food webs, the network of feeding links in a community of species, should take into account the inherent variability of ecological interactions. Harnessing this variability, we will show that it is useful to interpret empirically observed food webs as realisations of a family of stochastic processes, namely random dot-product graph models. These models provide an ideal extension of food-web models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. As an additional beneﬁt, our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits: this allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. Lastly, our results suggest the notion that the evolutionary signature in food webs is already detectable in their stochastic backbones, while the contribution of their ﬁne wiring is arguable. Synthesis Food webs are influenced by many stochastic processes and are constantly evolving. Here, we treat observed food webs as realisations of random dot-product graph models (RDPG), extending food-web modelling beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. Our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise-distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits, which in turn allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. It also provides a way to measure the phylogenetic signal present in food webs, which we find is strongest in webs' low-dimensional backbones.},

	abstract = {Evidence from grassland experiments suggests that a plant community's phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a strong predictor of ecosystem processes, even stronger than species richness per se. This has, however, never been extended to species-rich forests and host–parasitoid interactions. We used cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and their parasitoids collected in a subtropical forest as a model system to test whether hosts, parasitoids, and their interactions are influenced by tree PD and a comprehensive set of environmental variables, including tree species richness. Parasitism rate and parasitoid abundance were positively correlated with tree PD. All variables describing parasitoids decreased with elevation, and were, except parasitism rate, dependent on host abundance. Quantitative descriptors of host–parasitoid networks were independent of the environment. Our study indicates that host–parasitoid interactions in species-rich forests are related to the PD of the tree community, which influences parasitism rates through parasitoid abundance. We show that effects of tree community PD are much stronger than effects of tree species richness, can cascade to high trophic levels, and promote trophic interactions. As during habitat modification phylogenetic information is usually lost non-randomly, even species-rich habitats may not be able to continuously provide the ecosystem process parasitism if the evolutionarily most distinct plant lineages vanish.},

The identification of the biological characteristics of these species is of major importance for the understanding and conservation of seed-dispersal interactions. In this study, I use a network approach and avian seed-dispersal networks from 23 different geographical areas to test five hypotheses about species characteristics determining the structure of the assemblage. I expected (i) large birds to forage on a large number of fruits and (ii) large fruits to be dispersed by few bird species (because of morphological constraints), and (iii) highly energetic fruits to be dispersed by more bird species (in accordance with optimal foraging theory). Besides the number of interacting partners, I also expected (iv) large birds and (v) small energetic fruits to be important for the maintenance of the structure of the interactions in seed-dispersal networks. As species that are closely related are more likely to be similar to each other, I performed phylogenetically corrected analyses to account for this data dependence. Although bird size was not associated to species important in the maintenance of the structure of the seed-dispersal community, I identified that bird species whose diet was strongly dependent on fruits were important for the structure of the network. Regarding the plants, I found that large fruits were dispersed by fewer species, but the most important attribute to predict the role of a fruit was its energy content (higher energy, more bird species dispersing the plant, but low-energy fruits being of conservation concern because they are dispersed by specific species). The results of this study suggest that the role of the species in seed-dispersal assemblages seems to be determined by the role of the species as consumers (frugivory degree for animals) or by their nutritional inputs (energy content for fruits) rather than by morphological constrains.},

The method combines fuzzy set theory and matrix correlation, implemented under a Monte Carlo framework. We designed a simulation study in order to estimate the accuracy of the methods proposed here, measuring Type I Error rates. The simulation study shows that the method is accurate, i.e., incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis in {\textasciitilde}5\% of the cases and falling within the confidence interval.

	abstract = {That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal, the congruence of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction, extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date, cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study, we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction: (1) across plant–pollinator associations globally, (2) in local pollination communities, (3) within the modular structure of those communities, and (4) in individual modules. We did so using a globally distributed dataset comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000 interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of plant–pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of individual modules and most typically when within-module phylogenetic diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator–angiosperm interactions.},

	abstract = {With global change modifying species assemblages, our success in predicting ecosystem-level consequences of these new communities will depend, in part, on our ability to understand biotic interactions. Current food web theory considers interactions between numerous species simultaneously, but descriptive models are unable to predict interactions between newly co-occurring species. Incorporating proxies such as functional traits and phylogeny into models could help infer predator/prey interactions. Here, we used trait matching between predator feeding traits and prey vulnerability traits, along with phylogeny (used as a proxy for chemical defence and other traits difficult to document), to infer predatory interactions using ground beetles as model organisms. A feeding experiment was conducted involving 20 ground beetle and 115 prey species to determine which pair of species did or did not interact. Eight predator and four prey functional traits were measured directly on specimens. Then, using a modelling approach based on the matching-centrality formalism, we evaluated 511 predictive ecological models that tested different combinations of all predator and prey functional traits, and phylogenetic information. The most parsimonious model accurately predicted 81\% of the observed realized and unrealized interactions, using phylogenetic information and the trait-matches predator biting force/prey cuticular toughness and predator/prey body size ratio. The best trait-based models predicted correctly {\textgreater}80\% which species interact (realized interactions), but predict {\textless}58\% of which species did not interact (unrealized interactions). Adding a phylogenetic term representing the evolutionary distance within each trophic level increased the ability to predict which species did not interact to {\textgreater}75\%. The matching of predator biting force and prey cuticular toughness demonstrated a better predictive power than the commonly used predator/prey body size ratio. Our novel model combining both functional traits and phylogeny extends beyond existing descriptive approaches and could represent a valuable tool to predict consumer/resource interactions of newly introduced species and to resolve cryptic food webs.

Here we show that, in a host-parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal.

This study includes the evolutionary histories of species among the potential drivers of interactions, allowing the comparative analysis of its importance in structuring ecological networks. We hypothesized different possible phylogenetic scenarios to predict frequencies of interactions between species by combining concepts from the fields of ecological networks and ecophylogenetics. The usage of these scenarios is illustrated in a plant-hummingbird interaction network database from the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. We first evaluated which phylogenetic hypotheses better predict the observed network; subsequently, we evaluated the relative importance of species evolutionary histories, abundances, and matching on species morphologies and phenologies as drivers of their frequencies of interactions. The results suggest that the evolutionary histories of hummingbirds are more important than the species abundances in structuring the studied plant-hummingbird network but less important than the morphological and phenological matching among species.

	abstract = {Studies of functional diversity (FD) have gained immense interest because they promise a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, the concept of FD is currently not used to its full potential because of several biases and shortcomings. For instance, while the analysis of traits related to species’ Grinnellian niches, i.e. traits influencing species’ fitness under different environmental conditions, is well-advanced, there is a lack of studies on the functional diversity related to species’ Eltonian niches, i.e. species’ functional roles in ecological processes and their effects on other species, a discrepancy known as the Eltonian Shortfall. Most importantly, the current indirect approach of measuring FD via species traits restricts analyses to species with similar traits, usually a taxon. Consequently, FD is generally measured for only one taxon but across different ecological processes, when it would ideally be measured for one ecological process but across all taxa that contribute to that process. These discrepancies hinder advances of our understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions and services. We introduce a new approach to measuring functional diversity that is designed to overcome these shortcomings by bridging research on networks, species niches, and functional traits. Instead of characterizing functional roles indirectly via species’ traits, we propose to characterize functional roles directly via the traits of species’ resources and interaction partners in a given ecological process. Critically, this shift in perspective for the first time allows comparisons of the functional roles of all taxa that participate in an ecological process regardless of their own morphology. We illustrate our new approach with a study on functional roles of frugivores in seed-dispersal systems. Our approach is an important addition to existing approaches to studying FD, and it facilitates new studies in a vastly unexplored field of functional diversity research.},

	abstract = {Ecological networks of two interacting guilds of species, such as flowering plants and pollinators, are common in nature, and studying their structure can yield insights into their resilience to environmental disturbances. Here we develop analytical methods for exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant?pollinator community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore, pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition; closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a common fate in a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Species community composition is known to alter the network of interactions between two trophic levels, potentially affecting its functioning (e.g. plant pollination success) and the stability of communities. Phylogenies vary in shape with regard to the rate of evolutionary change across a tree (influencing tree balance) and variation in the timing of branching events (affecting the distribution of node ages in trees), both of which may influence the structure of species interaction networks. Because related species are likely to share many of the traits that regulate interactions, the shape of phylogenetic trees may provide some insights into the distribution of traits within communities, and hence the likelihood of interaction among species. However, little attention has been paid to the potential effects of changes in phylogenetic diversity (PD) on interaction networks. Phylogenetic diversity is influenced by species diversity within a community, but also how distantly-related the constituent species are from one another. Here, we evaluate the relationship between two important measures of phylogenetic diversity (tree shape and age of nodes) and the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks using empirical and simulated data. Whereas the former allows us to evaluate patterns in real communities, the latter allows us to evaluate more systematically the relationship between tree shape and network structure under three different models of trait evolution. In empirical networks, less balanced plant phylogenies were associated with lower connectance in interaction networks indicating that communities with the descendants of recent radiations are more diverged and specialized in their partnerships. In simulations, tree balance and the distribution of nodes through time were included in the best models for modularity, and the second best models for connectance and nestedness. In models assuming random evolutionary change through time (i.e. Brownian motion), less balanced trees and trees with nodes near the tips exhibited greater modularity, whereas in models with an early burst of radiation followed by relative stasis (i.e. early-burst models) more balanced trees and trees with nodes near roots had greater modularity. Synthesis. Overall, these results suggest that the shape of phylogenies can influence the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks. However, the mismatch between simulations and empirical data indicate that no simple model of trait evolution mimics that observed in real communities.},

	abstract = {Interaction webs, or networks, define how the members of two or more trophic levels interact. However, the traits that mediate network structure have not been widely investigated. Generally, the mechanism that determines plant-pollinator partnerships is thought to involve the matching of a suite of species traits (such as abundance, phenology, morphology) between trophic levels. These traits are often unknown or hard to measure, but may reflect phylogenetic history. We asked whether morphological traits or phylogenetic history were more important in mediating network structure in mutualistic plant-pollinator interaction networks from Western Canada. At the plant species level, sexual system, growth form, and flower symmetry were the most important traits. For example species with radially symmetrical flowers had more connections within their modules (a subset of species that interact more among one another than outside of the module) than species with bilaterally symmetrical flowers. At the pollinator species level, social species had more connections within and among modules. In addition, larger pollinators tended to be more specialized. As traits mediate interactions and have a phylogenetic signal, we found that phylogenetically close species tend to interact with a similar set of species. At the network level, patterns were weak, but we found increasing functional trait and phylogenetic diversity of plants associated with increased weighted nestedness. These results provide evidence that both specific traits and phylogenetic history can contribute to the nature of mutualistic interactions within networks, but they explain less variation between networks.},

	abstract = {Tropical mountains are hotspots of biodiversity, but the factors that generate this high diversity remain poorly understood. To identify possible mechanisms that influence avian species assemblages in the tropical Andes, we studied the functional and phylogenetic diversity and the structure of species assemblages of an avian feeding guild. We analysed how functional and phylogenetic diversity, structure and composition of frugivorous bird assemblages changed along a 3300 m elevational transect from the lowlands to the tree line with a novel combination of functional and phylogenetic approaches, and used null models to infer possible drivers of the observed patterns. Species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased almost monotonically with increasing elevation, but assemblage structure and composition changed abruptly in the Andean foothills at around 1200 m. In the lowland assemblages, species were functionally and phylogenetically less similar than expected from null models, whereas species in the highland assemblages were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance, suggesting an abrupt reduction in the number of functionally and phylogenetically distinct species in the transition from lowlands to the highlands. Nevertheless, the functional and phylogenetic evenness of the assemblages, i.e. the regularity of the spacing of species in functional trait space and phylogeny, remained constant along the gradient, which suggests that the mechanisms that influence the co-occurrence of species within the assemblages are similar in lowlands and highlands. The observed differences between lowland and highland assemblages imply sharp distributional limits for frugivorous bird species in the Andean foothills, probably caused by environmental factors other than climate, e.g. changes in habitat types or topography, or independent species radiations in lowlands and highlands. These strong distributional limits may hinder uphill range shifts of frugivorous bird species, and the plant species they disperse, in the tropical Andes as a response to climate change.},

This notwithstanding, the challenge of understanding more complex systems has repeatedly generated interest in the role of so-called higher-order interactions (HOIs) imposed by species beyond the focal pair. Here we argue that HOIs – defined as non-additive effects of density on per capita growth – are best interpreted as emergent properties of phenomenological models (e.g. Lotka–Volterra competition) rather than as distinct ‘ecological processes’ in their own right. Using simulations of consumer-resource models, we explore the mechanisms and system properties that give rise to HOIs in observational data. We demonstrate that HOIs emerge under all but the most restrictive of assumptions, and that incorporating non-additivity into phenomenological models improves the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of model predictions. Notably, we also observe that HOIs derive primarily from mechanisms and system properties that apply equally to single-species or pairwise systems as they do to more diverse communities. Consequently, there exists a strong mandate for further recognition of non-additive effects in both theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract = {A framework for the description and analysis of multilayer networks is established in statistical physics, and calls are increasing for their adoption by community ecologists. Multilayer networks in community ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact. Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join different networks—termed layers—together and represent ecological processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer edges representing movement for networks separated in space). Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However, multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche partitioning, the connection between traits and species’ interactions, and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution. Synthesis. Multilayer networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However, describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently, have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that underpin diversity in ecological communities.

First, we review the role of large vertebrates as seed dispersers in different tropical ecosystems to show that these species are likely to be important components of seed-dispersal networks. Second, we showed that, despite their importance, large vertebrates are absent from most of the seed-dispersal networks described in the available literature. We identified three main reasons for this absence: (1) large vertebrates have already died out in the studied areas; (2) studies focus on particular taxonomic groups that consist mostly of small birds; and (3) it is inherently difficult to describe the interactions of naturally rare and secretive species such as large vertebrates. We argue that a proper evaluation of the importance of large frugivores within seed-dispersal networks would benefit from considering aspects other than the frequency of interactions. We suggest weighting pairwise interactions by their ecological consequences to quantify the contribution of large frugivores to outcomes of seed dispersal, such as landscape connectivity.},

Fahrig concluded that to date there is no empirical evidence supporting the widespread assumption that a group of small habitat patches generally has lower ecological value than large patches of the same total area. Fletcher et al. (2018) dispute this conclusion, arguing that the literature to date indicates generally negative ecological effects of habitat fragmentation per se. They base their argument largely on extrapolation from patch-scale patterns and mechanisms (effects of patch size and isolation, and edge effects) to landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation. We argue that such extrapolation is unreliable because: (1) it ignores other mechanisms, especially those acting at landscape scales (e.g., increased habitat diversity, spreading of risk, landscape complementation) that can counteract effects of the documented patch-scale mechanisms; and (2) extrapolation of a small-scale mechanism to a large-scale pattern is not evidence of that pattern but, rather a prediction that must be tested at the larger scale. Such tests were the subject of Fahrig's review. We find no support for Fletcher et al.'s claim that biases in Fahrig's review would alter its conclusions. We encourage further landscape-scale empirical studies of effects of habitat fragmentation per se, and research aimed at uncovering the mechanisms that underlie positive fragmentation effects.},

	abstract = {Frugivores select their food in a hierarchical way, from plants to individual fruits, to meet their nutritional requirements. According to the optimal diet theory, finding, handling, and digesting fruits is costly, thus plant species that increase attractiveness and reward are usually preferred by frugivores. The same should be expected for individual plants of the same population, which differ from one another in traits related to frugivore attraction. We tested the hypothesis that plant traits that increase attractiveness and reward to frugivores would be strongly selected by birds in a population of Henriettea succosa (Melastomataceae). In 20 h of focal observation in 19 individual trees (380 h in total), we measured plant and fruit traits known to influence frugivore attraction and reward: plant height, fruit size, and fruit sugar content. In addition, we recorded bird behaviour during fruit consumption. We built two weighted networks of birds and individual plants: one monolayer network and a multilayer network with four layers, one for each type of behaviour. First, we evaluated three weighted descriptors of network structure: nestedness, modularity, and specialization. Then, we calculated metrics of centrality and correlated them with plant traits. We recorded 271 visits by 22 bird species of eight families. The network is modular and specialized, showing that subgroups of H. succosa trees with different trait combinations attract different subsets of bird species, in a way that specialist trees are not connected to a subset of the bird species that visit generalist trees. We also found that centrality metrics reached higher scores in plants with lower height, larger fruits, and intermediate sucrose content. Fruit handling was the predominant foraging behaviour in the multilayer network and represented 90 percent of the interactions. Downscaling a plant-frugivore network to its individual trees showed that the structure of the system is influenced by interindividual variations in the tree population, in which individuals with the best combination of traits occupied central positions in the network.},

Negative and neutral responses of tree phylogenetic diversity to land use change have been reported at local and landscape scales. Here, we hypothesized that such variable responses to disturbance depend on the regional context, being stronger in more degraded rain forest regions with a longer history of land use. Location Six regions in Mexico and Brazil. Methods We used a large vegetation database (6,923 trees from 686 species) recorded in 98 50-ha landscapes distributed across two Brazilian and four Mexican regions, which exhibit different degrees of disturbance. In each region, we assessed whether phylogenetic alpha and beta diversities were related to landscape-scale forest loss, the percentage of shade-intolerant species (a proxy of local disturbance) and/or the relatedness of decreasing (losers) and increasing (winners) taxa. Results Contrary to our expectations, the percentage of forest cover and shade-intolerant species were weakly related to phylogenetic alpha and beta diversities in all but one region. Loser species were generally as dispersed across the phylogeny as winner species, allowing more degraded, deforested and species-poorer forests to sustain relatively high levels of evolutionary (phylogenetic) diversity. Main conclusion Our findings support previous evidence indicating that traits related to high susceptibility to forest disturbances are convergent or have low phylogenetic signal. More importantly, they reveal that the evolutionary value of disturbed forests is (at least in a phylogenetic sense) much greater than previously thought.},

Yet, non-forest species can proliferate in deforested landscapes, thus enabling community-level attributes (e.g. total abundance and richness) to be maintained in the remaining forest patches. Such compensatory dynamics have been, however, poorly investigated regarding the phylogenetic dimension of species diversity. Here, we assessed whether compensatory dynamics can stabilize the phylogenetic richness, divergence and structure of bird communities in response to forest loss in two regions in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, each under with different levels of land use intensification. We surveyed birds in 40 forest sites, and assessed the response of five phylogenetic metrics to forest cover measured in local (600-m radius) landscapes. We separately assessed the entire community, forest-dependent and non-forest-dependent species and used information-theoretic criteria to assess the effect of forest cover on each response variable. In particular, we evaluated the plausibility of four models: a null model (no effect of forest cover), a linear model, a power law model (nonlinear effect) and an analysis of covariance model (to assess whether the effect of forest cover differed between regions). Forest cover varied from 7\% to 98\%, and was positively related to the phylogenetic richness of forest-dependent species, but negatively related to the phylogenetic richness and divergence of non-forest birds, particularly in the more disturbed region. As consequence, the phylogenetic richness and divergence of the entire community were weakly related to forest cover. Forest birds were less phylogenetically clustered in sites surrounded by lower forest cover, but the phylogenetic structure of non-forest birds was independent of forest cover. Synthesis and applications. The phylogenetic impoverishment of forest-dependent birds is offset by the phylogenetic enrichment and divergence of non-forest-dependent birds in severely tropical deforested landscapes. These compensatory dynamics suggest that both bird groups are important for safeguarding bird evolutionary diversity in human-modified landscapes. Although deforested landscapes are reservoirs of bird phylogenetic diversity, suggesting that ecosystem functioning may be maintained in these sites, preventing further deforestation is urgently needed to preserve forest birds and their key ecological roles in the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Functional traits associated with plant-animal interactions are essential for forest functionality, given that a higher diversity of fruit traits is likely to maintain a more diverse assemblage of frugivores and consequently promote the seed dispersal function. Yet, shade-intolerant species tend to persist in human-modified landscapes in the long term, which in turn is expect to reduce fruit trait diversity. Here we evaluate how forest cover at the landscape-scale influences the functional diversity of fruit traits, considering the zoochoric tree community and two regeneration strategies separately (shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species). We sampled 20 forest remnants in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, located in landscapes with forest cover ranging from 2 to 93\%. In each remnant, we established five plots of 25×4m and marked all trees ≥5cm diameter at breast height (DBH). We compared morphological and chemical attributes of fleshy fruits directly related to the attraction of frugivores, and evaluated the similarity of the zoochoric tree assemblage composition along the forest cover gradient, taking into account the two regeneration strategies. We calculated four functional indices (richness, evenness, divergence, and community-level weighted means of trait values) and used either linear models or spatial mixed linear models to evaluate the effects of forest cover on functional diversity. Our main results revealed that forest cover loss has negatively affected fruit functional diversity for the overall zoochoric community. Forest cover loss also affected functional richness and functional eveness for total and shade-tolerant species, and was positively correlated with the content of protein and lipid in fruits of shade-intolerant species. Additionally, sites exhibiting a lower amount of forest cover showed greater compositional similarity among shade-intolerant species but reduced similarity among shade-tolerant species. We conclude that patterns of species reassembly triggered by landscape-scale deforestation decreases the capacity of the remaining forest for provisioning food resources for frugivore assemblages. The maintenance of shade-tolerant species is pivotal in deforested areas, since their fruit quality is not offset by shade-intolerant species. This is particularly important, mainly because shade-intolerant species are those still persisting in disturbed forests; however, their presence will not provide the same food quality supplied by those species lost.},

Understanding how forest loss impacts on species diversity can, therefore, contribute to identifying the minimum amount of habitat required for biodiversity maintenance in human-modified landscapes. Here, we evaluate how the amount of forest cover, at the landscape scale, affects patterns of species richness, abundance, key functional traits and common taxonomic families of adult trees in twenty Brazilian Atlantic rainforest landscapes. We found that as forest cover decreases, both tree community richness and abundance decline, without exhibiting a threshold. At the family-level, species richness and abundance of the Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae were also negatively impacted by the percent forest remaining at the landscape scale. For functional traits, we found a reduction in shade-tolerant, animal-dispersed and small-seeded species following a decrease in the amount of forest retained in landscapes. These results suggest that the amount of forest in a landscape is driving non-random losses in phylogenetic and functional tree diversity in Brazil’s remaining Atlantic rainforests. Our study highlights potential restraints on the conservation value of Atlantic rainforest remnants in deforested landscapes in the future.},

However, we do not know how fruit production is temporally distributed over species and families. Two plant families are particularly important in floristic inventories of Atlantic rain forests: Arecaceae, a few species of which are highly abundant; and Myrtaceae, which is abundant and displays outstanding species diversity. In this context, we asked whether hyperdominance occurs in fruit production in the Atlantic rain forest, and whether it occurs in the abundant species of Arecaceae and Myrtaceae. We investigated whether the temporal fruit production patterns differ between Myrtaceae, Arecaceae, and the plant community as a whole. We also applied a functional dispersion index to assess the temporal fruit diversity over a 2-yr period, with regard to morphological and phenological traits. We found that the phenomenon of hyperdominance occurs in fruit production: five species accounted for more than half of the pulp biomass. Arecaceae fruit biomass peaked at the end of wet season, overlapping with the community peak; whereas Myrtaceae species fruited throughout the year and were an important resource during periods of food scarcity. Myrtaceae filled more of the fruit morphospace over time because their fruits exhibit a large range of morphologies and phenological strategies. Our results demonstrated the importance of combining phenology and fruit morphology in the evaluation of resource availability, which revealed periods of high fruit diversity that could support a range of frugivore sizes and maintain overall ecosystem functionality.},

We sampled 20 forest fragments located within landscapes with forest cover ranging from 2 to 93 percent in the Atlantic forest of southern Bahia, Brazil. In each fragment, we established five plots of 25 × 4 m and carried out phenological observations on fleshy fruit throughout 1 year on all trees ≥5 cm dbh. We estimated fruit availability by direct counting of all fruits and derived fruit biomass from this count. We used spatial mixed linear models to evaluate the effects of forest cover on species richness, abundance, and fruit biomass. Our results indicated that forest cover was the main explanatory variable and negatively influenced the total richness and abundance of zoochoric and shade-tolerant but not shade-intolerant species. A linear model best explained variations in richness and abundance of total and shade-tolerant species. We also found that forest cover was positively correlated with the fruit biomass produced by all species and by the shade-tolerant assemblages, with linear models best explaining both relationships. The loss of shade-tolerant species and the lower fruit production in fragments with lower landscape-scale forest cover may have implications for the maintenance of frugivore, seed dispersal service, and plant recruitment.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss has been long recognized as a major driver of the current species extinction crisis, but to date few studies have estimated deforestation thresholds above which biodiversity negatively respond to the changes in landscape configuration. In this study, we used a very representative understory plant family (Rubiaceae) to evaluate the effects of forest cover reduction in the landscape on taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity, species originality, and composition. We selected nine Atlantic forest sites in southern Bahia, Brazil, immersed in landscapes ranging from 9\% to 71\% of remaining forest cover. We established a 50×100m plot in each site and identified all the Rubiaceae individuals. Forest cover reduction at the landscape scale is strongly and negatively related to the number of individuals, species, and genera of Rubiaceae. Our model predicts that every 10\% decreasing in landscape forest cover results in the loss of about three species and 74 individuals of understory Rubiaceae. Canopy openness at the plot level increased linearly with the decrease of forest cover in the landscape. A trend of linear decrease of the phylogenetic diversity with the loss of forest cover was also observed, increasing the co-occurrence of close relatives in more deforested landscapes. Furthermore, we found a reduction in the presence of species with higher values of originality along the gradient of forest cover, as a consequence of species richness reduction. Regardless of the geographical distances, areas with similar values of forest cover were different in composition (β-diversity) and phylogenetic relationship (phylogenetic β-diversity), indicating that even highly deforested landscapes contribute to the regional diversity. We concluded that less forested areas are losing species richness and diversity, and as a consequence species originality, and presenting a general trend of phylogenetic impoverishment at the landscape scale. However, regional conservation initiatives should take all landscapes into account, because they all contribute to taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity, to ensure the long-term protection of the irreplaceable evolutionary history of Rubiaceae and the numerous organisms it supports.},

	abstract = {Ongoing urban development has significant effects on ecosystems, including changes to land cover, environmental conditions, and species’ distributions. These various impacts may have opposing or interacting effects on plant communities, making it difficult to predict how plant biodiversity will respond to urban development. A frequently cited conceptual framework predicts how urban development influences plant taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity by simplifying multiple coincident effects of urbanization into four primary filters of biodiversity: habitat transformation, fragmentation, the urban environment, and human preferences. Each filter prevents some plant species from persisting in urban areas while promoting others, but species introductions according to human preferences are expected to cause a net increase in biodiversity while the other filters limit diversity. In this study, we used structural equation modeling to test these predictions and examine the relative importance of each filter on the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of riparian forest plant species sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. Most diversity measures declined with urbanization, but some (e.g., functional Rao's Q) increased with urbanization. We found support for some of the predicted relationships between urbanization filters and biodiversity, as well as some unexpected relationships, including positive effects of urban environments. Overall, urban environments and human preferences were stronger predictors than habitat transformation and fragmentation. Our approach could be used to test a general framework predicting the effects of urbanization on plant diversity across multiple cities and contribute to a more synthetic understanding of urban biodiversity.},

We detected a significant loss of tree phylogenetic diversity in forest edges, but not in core areas of small ({\textless}80 ha) forest fragments. This was attributed to a reduction of 11\% in the average phylogenetic distance between any two randomly chosen individuals from forest edges; an increase of 17\% in the average phylogenetic distance to closest non-conspecific relative for each individual in forest edges; and to the potential manifestation of late edge effects in the core areas of small forest remnants. We found no evidence supporting fragmentation-induced phylogenetic clustering or evenness. This could be explained by the low phylogenetic conservatism of key life-history traits corresponding to vulnerable species. Edge effects must be reduced to effectively protect tree phylogenetic diversity in the severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest.},

	abstract = {Aim To identify characteristics of a human-modified landscape that promote taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) dimensions of bat biodiversity. Location Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. Methods During the dry and wet seasons, we quantified TD (Simpson's diversity), as well as FD and PD (Rao's quadratic entropy) of phyllostomid bat assemblages at 15 sites that represented a forest loss and fragmentation gradient. FD was estimated separately for each of seven functional components that reflect particular niche axes (e.g. diet, foraging strategy) and for all functional components combined (FDall). PD was based on relatedness of species derived from a supertree. We identified the best explanatory landscape characteristics of each dimension using hierarchical partitioning. Results Landscape effects were dimension and season specific. During the dry season, TD and PD increased with increasing proportions of pasture or size of forest patches, whereas FDall decreased with increasing size of forest patches. During the wet season, TD increased with increasing forest patch size, whereas FDall and PD increased with increasing compactness of forest patches and decreasing proximity. Decomposition of FD into separate functional components revealed different landscape effects on ecological aspects of assemblages. Main conclusions One dimension of biodiversity was not a good surrogate for another. Rather, decomposition of biodiversity into different dimensions and functional components facilitated identification of the aspects of assemblages that are most affected by forest conversion and fragmentation. Areas with intermediate amounts of forest and pasture during the dry season harboured highest diversity from taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic perspectives. During the wet season, areas with large, compact forest patches promoted the dimensions of biodiversity. Placement of areas with even amounts of forest and pasture adjacent to large, compact forest patches (e.g. reserves) may maintain high biodiversity of bats and the ecosystem functions that they provide throughout the year.},

	abstract = {Understanding how interspecific variation in functional traits influences species’ capacity to persist in fragments and use patches in fragmented landscapes is fundamental for the creation of effective conservation plans. This study uses phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate which functional traits of bat species are correlated with their vulnerability to fragmentation in a tropical landscape with low fragment–matrix contrast. Bats were captured over two years in eight forest fragments, nine control sites in continuous forest, and in the secondary forest matrix at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazon, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between species functional traits, environmental gradients (continuous forest and fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and patterns of species distribution using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, as well as a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Mobility, body mass, wing morphology, and trophic level were the most important traits linked to fragmentation sensitivity based on the PGLS analysis, while body mass and trophic level emerged as the best predictors in the fourth-corner analysis. These last two traits were correlated with the loss of continuous forest characteristics, such as high-stature trees and forest cover. Many animalivorous bat species rarely persist in small fragments ({\textless}100 ha) and in the secondary forest matrix, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit the smaller and phytophagous species. Synthesis and applications. Functional traits of species and environmental variables jointly predict local variation in patterns of bat occupancy and abundance in fragmented tropical landscapes. To minimize local extinctions, we recommend increasing habitat availability and enhancing structural and functional connectivity at the landscape scale through the creation, restoration and maintenance of corridors and stepping stones. These measures should be coupled with improving matrix quality by promoting secondary forest regeneration and persistence to effectively reduce fragment–matrix contrast.},

However, it is not clear whether such forms of competition can predict the collapse of communities and associated shifts in ecosystem function in the face of environmental change. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional trait data to test whether communities of two ecologically important guilds of tropical birds (frugivores and insectivores) are structured by species interactions in a fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. In both guilds, we found that forest patch size, quality, and degree of isolation influence the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of communities, with small, degraded, or isolated forest patches having an increased signature of competition (i.e., phylogenetic and functional trait overdispersion in relation to null models). These results suggest that local extinctions in the context of fragmentation are nonrandom, with a consistent bias toward more densely occupied regions of niche space. We conclude that the loss of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is mediated by niche-based competitive interactions among species, with potentially far-reaching implications for key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal and plant damage by phytophagous insects.},

We assessed land-use intensification with a synthetic index based on landscape metrics (total area and relative percentages of land uses, edge density, mean patch density and diversity, and fractal structures at 5 dates from 1990 to 2007). Species richness decreased consistently as agricultural intensification increased despite slight differences in the responses of sampled groups. Globally, in moderately deforested landscapes species richness was relatively stable, and there was a clear threshold in biodiversity loss midway along the intensification gradient, mainly linked to a drop in forest cover and quality.

In order to test these effects, we built models for explaining understory birds occurrence in a fragmented Atlantic Rain Forest landscape with intermediate habitat cover (3\%). Data from over 9000 mist-net hours from 17 fragments differing in size (2–175ha) and connectivity (considering corridor linkages and distance to nearby fragments) were ranked under a model selection approach. A total 1293 individuals of 62 species were recorded. Species richness, abundance and compositional variation were mainly affected by connectivity indices that consider the capacity of species to use corridors and/or to cross short distances up to 30m through the matrix. Bird functional groups were differently affected by area and connectivity: while terrestrial insectivores, omnivores and frugivores were affected by both area and connectivity, the other groups (understory insectivores, nectarivores, and others) were affected only by connectivity. In the studied landscape, well connected fragments can sustain an elevated number of species and individuals. Connectivity gives the opportunity for individuals to use multiple fragments, reducing the influence of fragment size. While preserving large fragments is a conservation target worldwide and should continue to be, our results indicated that connectivity between fragments can enhance the area functionally connected and is beneficial to all functional groups and therefore should be a conservation priority.},

To account for the variability in forest structure among fragments, we described and minimized the influence of foliage density and stratification on small mammal data. Sites were distributed among three categories of fragment size and in continuous forest. For small and medium-sized categories, we considered isolated fragments and fragments connected by corridors to larger remnants. Small mammal abundance and alpha and beta diversity were regressed against site scores from the first axis of a Principal Component Analysis on forest structure variables. Residuals were used in analyses of variance to compare fragment size and connectivity categories. Forest structure influenced total abundance and abundance of some species individually, but not the diversity of small mammal communities. Total abundance and alpha diversity were lower in small and medium-sized fragments than in large fragments and continuous forest, and in isolated compared to connected fragments. Three species were less common, but none was more abundant in smaller fragments. At least one species was more abundant in connected compared to isolated fragments. Beta diversity showed an opposite relationship to fragment size and corridors, increasing in small and isolated fragments. Results highlight the importance of secondary forest for the conservation of tropical fauna, the hyper-dynamism of small isolated fragments and the potential of corridors to buffer habitat fragmentation effects in tropical landscapes.},

	abstract = {The future of tropical forest biodiversity depends more than ever on the effective management of human-modified landscapes, presenting a daunting challenge to conservation practitioners and land use managers. We provide a critical synthesis of the scientific insights that guide our understanding of patterns and processes underpinning forest biodiversity in the human-modified tropics, and present a conceptual framework that integrates a broad range of social and ecological factors that define and contextualize the possible future of tropical forest species. A growing body of research demonstrates that spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity are the dynamic product of interacting historical and contemporary human and ecological processes. These processes vary radically in their relative importance within and among regions, and have effects that may take years to become fully manifest. Interpreting biodiversity research findings is frequently made difficult by constrained study designs, low congruence in species responses to disturbance, shifting baselines and an over-dependence on comparative inferences from a small number of well studied localities. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the potential prospects for biodiversity conservation can be explained by regional differences in biotic vulnerability and anthropogenic legacies, an ever-tighter coupling of human-ecological systems and the influence of global environmental change. These differences provide both challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. Building upon our synthesis we outline a simple adaptive-landscape planning framework that can help guide a new research agenda to enhance biodiversity conservation prospects in the human-modified tropics.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss has pervasive and disruptive impacts on biodiversity in habitat remnants. The magnitude of the ecological impacts of habitat loss can be exacerbated by the spatial arrangement – or fragmentation – of remaining habitat. Fragmentation per se is a landscape-level phenomenon in which species that survive in habitat remnants are confronted with a modified environment of reduced area, increased isolation and novel ecological boundaries. The implications of this for individual organisms are many and varied, because species with differing life history strategies are differentially affected by habitat fragmentation. Here, we review the extensive literature on species responses to habitat fragmentation, and detail the numerous ways in which confounding factors have either masked the detection, or prevented the manifestation, of predicted fragmentation effects. Large numbers of empirical studies continue to document changes in species richness with decreasing habitat area, with positive, negative and no relationships regularly reported. The debate surrounding such widely contrasting results is beginning to be resolved by findings that the expected positive species-area relationship can be masked by matrix-derived spatial subsidies of resources to fragment-dwelling species and by the invasion of matrix-dwelling species into habitat edges. Significant advances have been made recently in our understanding of how species interactions are altered at habitat edges as a result of these changes. Interestingly, changes in biotic and abiotic parameters at edges also make ecological processes more variable than in habitat interiors. Individuals are more likely to encounter habitat edges in fragments with convoluted shapes, leading to increased turnover and variability in population size than in fragments that are compact in shape. Habitat isolation in both space and time disrupts species distribution patterns, with consequent effects on metapopulation dynamics and the genetic structure of fragment-dwelling populations. Again, the matrix habitat is a strong determinant of fragmentation effects within remnants because of its role in regulating dispersal and dispersal-related mortality, the provision of spatial subsidies and the potential mediation of edge-related microclimatic gradients. We show that confounding factors can mask many fragmentation effects. For instance, there are multiple ways in which species traits like trophic level, dispersal ability and degree of habitat specialisation influence species-level responses. The temporal scale of investigation may have a strong influence on the results of a study, with short-term crowding effects eventually giving way to long-term extinction debts. Moreover, many fragmentation effects like changes in genetic, morphological or behavioural traits of species require time to appear. By contrast, synergistic interactions of fragmentation with climate change, human-altered disturbance regimes, species interactions and other drivers of population decline may magnify the impacts of fragmentation. To conclude, we emphasise that anthropogenic fragmentation is a recent phenomenon in evolutionary time and suggest that the final, long-term impacts of habitat fragmentation may not yet have shown themselves.},

Location Global, including all six major biogeographical realms (Afrotropics, Australasia, Indo-Malaya, Nearctic, Neotropics and Palaearctic). Methods First, we examine the taxonomic distribution of avian frugivory within orders and families. Second we evaluate, with traditional and spatial regression approaches, the geographical patterns of frugivore species richness and proportion. Third, we test the potential of contemporary climate (water–energy, productivity, seasonality), habitat heterogeneity (topography, habitat diversity) and biogeographical history (captured by realm membership) to explain geographical patterns of avian frugivory. Results Most frugivorous birds (50\%) are found within the perching birds (Passeriformes), but the woodpeckers and allies (Piciformes), parrots (Psittaciformes) and pigeons (Columbiformes) also contain a significant number of frugivorous species (9–15\%). Frugivore richness is highest in the Neotropics, but peaks in overall bird diversity in the Himalayan foothills, the East African mountains and in some areas of Brazil and Bolivia are not reflected by frugivores. Current climate explains more variance in species richness and proportion of frugivores than of non-frugivores whereas it is the opposite for habitat heterogeneity. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) emerges as the best single climatic predictor variable of avian frugivory. Significant differences in frugivore richness and proportion between select biogeographical regions remain after differences in environment (i.e. AET) are accounted for. Main conclusions We present evidence that both environmental and historical constraints influence global patterns of avian frugivory. Whereas water–energy dynamics possibly constrain frugivore distribution via indirect effects on food plants, regional differences in avian frugivory most likely reflect historical contingencies related to the evolutionary history of fleshy fruited plant taxa, niche conservatism and past climate change. Overall our results support an important role of co-diversification and environmental constraints on regional assembly over macroevolutionary time-scales.},

A fundamental uncertainty is whether and how species adapt to communicate with groups of mutualists having distinct sensory abilities. We quantified the colour conspicuousness of flowers and fruits originating from one European and two South American plant communities, using visual models of pollinators (bee and fly) and seed dispersers (bird, primate and marten). We show that flowers are more conspicuous than fruits to pollinators, and the reverse to seed dispersers. In addition, flowers are more conspicuous to pollinators than to seed dispersers and the reverse for fruits. Thus, despite marked differences in the visual systems of mutualists, flower and fruit colours have evolved to attract multiple, distinct mutualists but not unintended perceivers. We show that this adaptation is facilitated by a limited correlation between flower and fruit colours, and by the fact that colour signals as coded at the photoreceptor level are more similar within than between functional groups (pollinators and seed dispersers). Overall, these results provide the first quantitative demonstration that flower and fruit colours are adaptations allowing plants to communicate simultaneously with distinct groups of mutualists.},

These metrics can be used in conjunction with permutation procedures to test for phylogenetic community structure. As an illustration, we analyzed data on the composition of 58 lake fish communities in Wisconsin. The fish communities showed phylogenetic underdispersion, with communities more likely to contain closely related species. Using information about differences in environmental characteristics among lakes, we demonstrated that phylogenetic underdispersion in fish communities was associated with environmental factors. For example, lakes with low pH were more likely to contain species in the same clade of acid‐tolerant species. Our metrics differ from existing metrics used to calculate phylogenetic community structure, such as net relatedness index and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity. Our metrics have the advantage of providing an integrated and easy‐to‐understand package of phylogenetic measures of species variability, richness, and evenness with well‐defined statistical properties.

	abstract = {Protecting biological diversity with limited resources may require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.},

Such “unimodal” responses have been documented in many field and laboratory studies and have usually been attributed to differences among species in competitive ability and/or trade‐offs between competitive ability and tolerance to disturbance. Here we show that most documented patterns of disturbance‐richness and productivity‐richness relationships, as well as the observed interactions between the two factors, can be explained by a simple neutral model where all species are ecologically identical and lack trade‐offs in species characteristics.

	abstract = {A striking structural pattern of pollination networks is the presence of a few highly connected species which has implications for ecological and evolutionary processes that create and maintain diversity. To understand the structure and dynamics of pollination networks we need to know which mechanisms allow the emergence of highly connected species. We investigate whether social pollinator species are highly connected in pollination networks, and whether network structure is affected by the presence of high proportions of social pollinator species. Social insects are abundant, with long activity periods and, at the highest level of social organisation, specialised foraging castes. These three attributes are likely to increase the number of interactions of social species and, consequently, their role in pollination networks. We find that social species have, on average, more prominent network roles than solitary species, a possible mechanism being the individual-rich colonies of social insects. However, when accounting for the shared evolutionary history of pollinators, sociality is only associated with highly interactive roles in Apidae. For apid bees, our structural equation analysis shows that the effect of sociality on species network roles is an indirect result of their high levels of interaction frequency. Despite the relative importance of sociality at a species-level, an increasing proportion of social species in pollination networks did not affect overall network structure. Our results suggest that behavioural traits may shape patterns of interaction of individual species but not the network-level organisation of species interactions. Instead, network structure appears to be determined by more general aspects of ecological systems such as interaction intimacy, patterns of niche overlap, and species abundance distributions.},

	abstract = {Abstract How do many species coexist within a trophic level? Resource niches are the classical answer, but in plants which share a small set of abiotic resources, the possibilities for resource partitioning are limited. One possible explanation is that plant species have different pollination niches, with each species specialized to a subset of the available animal species. If this pollinator partitioning results in negative frequency dependence such that each plant species? reproduction is reduced when it becomes abundant, pollination niches could maintain plant diversity, provided that the strength of negative frequency dependence is sufficient to overcome fitness inequalities between species. We tested this idea by quantifying the effect of species relative abundance on pollinator visitation rate in a 7,000 m2 plot of South African Fynbos vegetation. In addition, we quantified the effect of intraspecific abundance variation at a smaller spatial scale (9 m2 plots), documented species? pollination niches, and tested the importance of pollinators for seed set in a subset of the plant species. We found that visitation rate indeed declined sharply across the 33 plant species with increasing abundance, but visitation rate was also somewhat depressed in very rare species such that the resulting relationship between visitation rate and relative abundance was hump-shaped. Pollinator niche partitioning among plant species was evident, but less pronounced than in many other studies. Visitation rate was slightly higher in more generalized species, suggesting that they have access to a larger pollination resource. At the intraspecific level and smaller spatial scale, results were less clear and varied among species. Pollinators enhanced seed set in most species. Synthesis. The results imply that, above an abundance threshold, intraspecific competition for pollination could limit the reproduction of common species, thus promoting plant species coexistence. However, the rarest plant species could become extinct due to pollen limitation, that is, an Allee effect. In addition, interactions with pollinators may introduce frequency-independent fitness differences between plant species, thereby increasing the strength of negative frequency dependence required for stable coexistence. These findings shed new light on the role of the pollination niche in plant coexistence.},

	abstract = {Summary Sampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions. While the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of interactions among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e. ) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, that is life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically , resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance. Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to species inventories, a sizable fraction of non-observed pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological constraints that forbid their occurrence. Reasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the unobserved links when addressing sampling effort. Recent implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or for individual-based data can be combined with the assessment of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic estimate of interaction richness in a robustly sampled assemblage and the maximum richness of interactions. This is crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of defaunation-driven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.

Given the enormous quantitative pollen requirements of bees and their high efficiency in pollen removal, flowers should balance the need to attract bees for pollination on the one hand and to restrict pollen loss to bees on the other hand. Although various morphological flower traits have been identified that reduce excessive pollen losses to bees, the question of whether pollen might also be chemically protected remains largely unexplored. 2. In this study we compared the larval performance of the two very closely related and highly pollen generalist solitary bee species Osmia bicornis and Osmia cornuta on four different pollen diets. 3. Despite their very large pollen diet breadth, the two bee species showed striking differences in their ability to develop on pollen of the same plant species. Osmia bicornis developed well on Ranunculus pollen but failed to do so on Echium pollen, whereas the reverse held true for O. cornuta with the exception of two larvae grown on Ranunculus pollen that developed into dwarfish adults. Both bee species performed well on Sinapis pollen, while neither of the two species managed to develop on Tanacetum pollen. 4. The observed differences in larval survival of these two Osmia species when reared on the same pollen diet as well as their failure to develop on Tanacetum pollen clearly demonstrate that bees require physiological adaptations to cope with the unfavourable chemical properties of certain pollen. 5. Our results show a remarkable analogy of bee–flower relationships with herbivore–plant interactions and possibly indicate that the pollen of certain plant taxa might be chemically protected.},

	abstract = {Generalist herbivorous insects, which feed on plant tissue that is nutritionally heterogeneous or varies in its content of secondary metabolites, often benefit from dietary mixing through more balanced nutrient intake or reduced exposure to harmful secondary metabolites. Pollen is similarly heterogeneous as other plant tissue in its content of primary and secondary metabolites, suggesting that providing their offspring with mixed pollen diets might be a promising strategy for pollen generalist bees to complement nutrient imbalances or to mitigate harmful secondary metabolites of unfavourable pollen. In the present study, we compared larval performance of the pollen generalist solitary bee species Osmia cornuta (Megachilidae) on five experimental pollen diets that consisted of different proportions of unfavourable pollen diet of Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae) and favourable pollen diet of Sinapis arvensis (Brassicaceae). In addition, we microscopically analysed the pollen contained in the scopal brushes of field-collected females of O. cornuta and three closely related species to elucidate to what degree these pollen generalist bees mix pollen of different hosts in their brood cells. In striking contrast to a pure Ranunculus pollen diet, which had a lethal effect on most developing larvae of O. cornuta, larval survival, larval development time and adult body mass of both males and females remained nearly unaffected by the admixture of up to 50\% of Ranunculus pollen diet to the larval food. Between 42\% and 66\% of all female scopal pollen loads analysed contained mixtures of pollen from two to six plant families, indicating that pollen mixing is a common behaviour in O. cornuta and the three related bee species. The present study provides the first evidence that the larvae of pollen generalist bees can benefit from the nutrient content of unfavourable pollen without being negatively affected by its unfavourable chemical properties if such pollen is mixed with favourable pollen. We conclude that the widespread pollen mixing by females of pollen generalist bees should also be considered as a possible strategy to exploit flowers with unfavourable pollen and to optimize larval food quality.},

	abstract = {Domestic gardens typically consist of a mixture of native and non-native plants which support biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services, particularly in urban environments. Many gardeners wish to encourage biodiversity by choosing appropriate plant taxa. The value of native and non-native plants in supporting animal biodiversity is, however, largely unknown. The relative value of native and non-native garden plants to invertebrates was investigated in a replicated field experiment. Plots (deliberately akin to garden borders) were planted with one of three treatments, representing assemblages of plants based on origin (native, near-native and exotic). Invertebrates and resource measurements were recorded over four years. This paper reports the abundance of flower-visiting aerial insects (‘pollinators’) associated with the three plant assemblages. For all pollinator groups on all treatments, greater floral resource resulted in an increase in visits. There was, however, a greater abundance of total pollinators recorded on native and near-native treatments compared with the exotic plots. Short-tongued bumblebees followed the same pattern whilst more hoverflies were recorded on the native treatment than the other treatments, and more honeybees on the near-native treatment. There was no difference between treatments in abundance of long-tongued bumblebees or solitary bees. The lack of difference in solitary bee abundance between treatments was probably due to a third of individuals from this group being recorded on one exotic plant species. The number of flower visitors corresponded to the peak flowering period of the treatments, that is there were fewer flower visitors to the exotic treatment compared with the other treatments in early summer but relatively more later in the season. Synthesis and applications. This experiment has demonstrated that utilizing plants from only a single region of origin (i.e. nativeness) may not be an optimal strategy for resource provision for pollinating insects in gardens. Gardens can be enhanced as a habitat by planting a variety of flowering plants, biased towards native and near-native species but with a selection of exotics to extend the flowering season and potentially provide resources for specialist groups.},

However, effective floral provisioning measures may diverge among different pollinator conservation targets, such as the conservation of rare species or the promotion of economically important crop pollinators. We examined to what extent such diverging conservation goals could be reconciled. We analysed plant–bee visitation networks of 64 herbaceous semi-natural habitats representing a gradient of plant species richness to identify key resource plants of the three distinct conservation target groups: rare bees (of conservation concern), dominant wild crop-pollinating bees and managed crop-pollinating bees (i.e. honeybees). Considering overall flower visitation, rare bees tended to visit nested subsets of plant species that were also visited by crop pollinators (46\% and 77\% nestedness in the dissimilarity between rare bees and wild crop pollinators or managed honeybees respectively). However, the set of preferred plant species, henceforth ‘key plant species’ (i.e. those species disproportionately more visited than expected according to their floral abundance) was considerably more distinct and less nested among bee target groups. Flower visits of all bee target groups increased with plant species richness at a similar rate. Importantly, our analyses revealed that an exponential increase in the flower abundance of the identified key plant species and complementarity in the bee visitation pattern across plant species ─ rather than total flower abundance ─ were the major drivers of these relationships. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the multiple goals of preserving high bee diversity, conserving rare species and sustaining crop pollinators can be reconciled if key plant species of different target groups are simultaneously available. This availability is facilitated by a high floral resource complementarity in the plant community. The list of identified key resource plant species we provide here can help practitioners such as land managers and conservationists to better design and evaluate pollinator conservation and restoration measures according to their goals. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying and promoting such plant species for pollinator conservation in agricultural landscapes.},

We evaluated effects on reproductive success of field bean (Vicia faba) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) using data from two study systems, both including study sites (1 km radius) with (flower strip sites) or without flower strips (control sites). To assess whether flower strips enhance pollination in the wider landscape, we compared the reproductive success between plants growing in field borders ({\textgreater} 160 m to nearest flower strip) at flower strips sites and control sites. We also tested if flower strips reallocate pollination functions in the landscape. We did this by comparing the reproductive success of plants at flower strip sites, growing adjacent to the flower strips with plants growing in a more distant field border at the same site ({\textgreater} 160 m). Finally, we tested if these potential effects depended on the heterogeneity of the landscape. In field borders without an adjacent flower strip, plant reproductive success was unaffected by the presence of a flower strip at the site, and increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity independently of site type (flower strip vs. control). In contrast, adjacent to the flower strips, reproductive success declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity, resulting in a positive net effect of adjacent flower strips in homogeneous landscapes and a negative effect in heterogeneous landscapes. Our results show that while decreasing landscape heterogeneity may impair pollination in homogeneous landscapes, this can be locally mitigated by sowing flower strips. However, in heterogeneous landscapes, flower strips may instead reduce pollination of adjacent plants.},

	abstract = {The diversity and abundance of insect pollinators are declining. This decline reduces the potential ecosystem services of pollination for wild and cultivated plants. Specific agri-environment schemes (AES) are subsidised to support and conserve biodiversity in farmlands. In Belgium, the pollinator flower-strips AES, strips of flower-rich hay meadows, has been promoted as a potential scheme to increase pollinator abundance and diversity, even if their effectiveness has not been locally evaluated. The main objective of this research is to assess the capacity of pollinator-strip AES to provide flower-resources to diverse pollinators. During 2 years, we monthly measured the availability of flower resources (pollen and nectar) produced on four flower-strips surrounded by intensive farming in Belgium. We counted and identified insects that visited these flowers, and we constructed the plant–insect interactions networks. The pollinator-strip AES presented a mix of both sown and spontaneous plant species. The ten sown plant species were all present, even after 8 years of strip settings. Three of them, Centaurea jacea, Lotus corniculatus, and Daucus carota were mainly visited for nectar collection, and a spontaneous non-sown species, Trifolium repens, had a key role in providing high-quality pollen to insects. Most of the observed flower-visiting insects belonged to common species of Hymenoptera and Diptera. All are considered highly efficient pollinators. The Belgian pollinator flower-strips are effective AES that provide flower resources to pollinators, mainly during summer and support pollination services. Nevertheless, spring and autumn flower resources remain poor and could reduce the strips’ effectiveness for supporting long-term insect diversity.},

Sowing a low-cost, simple mix of tall grasses resulted in a stable community dominated by competitive grasses. Creation of these habitats resulted in negligible shifts in the functional composition of the associated invertebrate community. Sowing a diverse mix of wildflowers resulted in a stable, perennial vegetation community with both legumes and regulating hemi-parasitic plants that supported significantly more pollinator and herbivore species, as well as higher abundances of beneficial arthropod predators. There were no measured synergies when a mix of tall grass and wildflower habitats were created adjacent to each other on the same margin.

	abstract = {1 Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands. 2 We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture. 3 In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects. 4 Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch. 5 Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted ({\textless} 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.},

	abstract = {There is ongoing concern regarding the observed decline in pollinator populations. Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current AES grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and hoverflies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the beginning of summer (Swiss AES management, control meadows); (ii) first cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control meadows but leaving 10–20\% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows, whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory hoverflies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by sweep-netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a common AES grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, the contrasting response of the life-history guilds indicates that promoting heterogeneous management practices within the landscape is important for supporting diverse communities, and maintaining key ecosystem services such as pollination and biocontrol.},

	abstract = {Understanding how reciprocal selection shapes interacting species in Darwin's coevolutionary race is a captivating pursuit in evolutionary ecology. Coevolving traits can potentially display following three patterns: (1) geographical variation in matched traits, (2) bias in trait matching, and (3) bimodal distribution of a trait in certain populations. Based on the framework of adaptive dynamics, we present an evolutionary model for a coevolving pollination system involving the long-proboscid fly (Moegistorhynchus longirostris) and the long-tubed iris (Lapeirousia anceps). The model successfully demonstrates that Darwin's hypothesis can lead to all three patterns if costs are involved. Geographical variation in matched traits could be driven by geographical variation in environmental factors that affect the cost rate of trait escalation. Unequal benefits derived from the interaction by the fly and the flower could potentially cause the bias in trait matching of the system. Different cost rates to trait elongation incurred by the two species and weak assortative interactions in the coevolutionary race can drive divergent selection (i.e., an evolutionary branching) that leads to the bimodal distribution of traits. Overall, the model highlights the importance of assortative interactions and the balance of costs incurred by coevolving species as factors determining the eventual phenotypic outcome of coevolutionary interactions.},

	abstract = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies finding significant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, significant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most significant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive significant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 significant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76\% were positive. Most significant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most significant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most significant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24\% of significant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for significant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive significant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justification for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This finding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial configuration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.},

Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

	abstract = {Women underrepresentation in science has frequently been associated with women being less productive than men (i.e. the gender productivity gap), which may be explained by women having lower success rates, producing science of lower impact and/or suffering gender bias. By performing global meta-analyses, we show that there is a gender productivity gap mostly supported by a larger scientific production ascribed to men. However, women and men show similar success rates when the researchers' work is directly evaluated (i.e. publishing articles). Men's success rate is higher only in productivity proxies involving peer recognition (e.g. evaluation committees, academic positions). Men's articles showed a tendency to have higher global impact but only if studies include self-citations. We detected gender bias against women in research fields where women are underrepresented (i.e. those different from Psychology). Historical numerical unbalance, socio-psychological aspects and cultural factors may influence differences in success rate, science impact and gender bias. Thus, the maintenance of a women-unfriendly academic and non-academic environment may perpetuate the gender productivity gap. New policies to build a more egalitarian and heterogeneous scientific community and society are needed to close the gender gap in science.},

	abstract = {Abstract An important dimension of a species' role is its ability to alter the state and maintain the diversity of its community. Centrality metrics have often been used to identify these species, which are sometimes referred as ?keystone? species. However, the relationship between centrality and keystoneness is largely phenomenological and based mostly on our intuition regarding what constitutes an important species. While centrality is useful when predicting which species' extinctions could cause the largest change in a community, it says little about how these species could be used to attain or preserve a particular community state. Here we introduce structural controllability, an approach that allows us to quantify the extent to which network topology can be harnessed to achieve a desired state. It also allows us to quantify a species' control capacity?its relative importance?and identify the set of species that are critical in this context because they have the largest possible control capacity. We illustrate the application of structural controllability with ten pairs of uninvaded and invaded plant-pollinator communities. We found that the controllability of a community is not dependent on its invasion status, but on the asymmetric nature of its mutual dependences. While central species were also likely to have a large control capacity, centrality fails to identify species that, despite being less connected, were critical in their communities. Interestingly, this set of critical species was mostly composed of plants and included every invasive species in our dataset. We also found that species with high control capacity, and in particular critical species, contribute the most to the stable coexistence of their community. This result was true, even when controlling for the species' degree, abundance/interaction strength, and the relative dependence of their partners. Synthesis. Structural controllability is strongly related to the stability of a network and measures the difficulty of managing an ecological community. It also identifies species that are critical to sustain biodiversity and to change or maintain the state of their community and are therefore likely to be very relevant for management and conservation.},

However, ecologists rarely test the attractiveness of chosen plants to pollinators in the field. Here, we experimentally test whether plant species roles in pollination networks can be used to identify species with the most potential to recover plant–pollinator communities. Using published pollination networks, we calculated each plant's centrality and chose five central and five peripheral plant species for introduction into replicate experimental plots. Flower visitation by pollinators was recorded in each plot and we tested the impact of introduced central and peripheral plant species on the pollinator and resident plant communities and on network structure. We found that the introduction of central plant species attracted a higher richness and abundance of pollinators than the introduction of peripheral species, and that the introduced central plant species occupied the most important network roles. The high attractiveness of central species to pollinators, however, did not negatively affect visitation to resident plant species by pollinators. We also found that the introduction of central plant species did not affect network structure, while networks with introduced peripheral species had lower centralisation and interaction evenness than networks with introduced central species. To our knowledge, this is the first time species network roles have been tested in a field experiment. Given that most restoration projects start at the plant community, being able to identify the plants with the highest potential to restore community structure and functioning should be a key goal for ecological restoration.},

Global environmental changes threaten these networks, underscoring the urgency for developing a predictive theory on how networks respond to perturbations. Here, I synthesise theoretical advances towards predicting network structure, dynamics, interaction strengths and responses to perturbations. I find that mathematical models incorporating biological mechanisms of mutualistic interactions provide better predictions of network dynamics. Those mechanisms include trait matching, adaptive foraging, and the dynamic consumption and production of both resources and services provided by mutualisms. Models incorporating species traits better predict the potential structure of networks (fundamental niche), while theory based on the dynamics of species abundances, rewards, foraging preferences and reproductive services can predict the extremely dynamic realised structures of networks, and may successfully predict network responses to perturbations. From a theoretician's standpoint, model development must more realistically represent empirical data on interaction strengths, population dynamics and how these vary with perturbations from global change. From an empiricist's standpoint, theory needs to make specific predictions that can be tested by observation or experiments. Developing models using short-term empirical data allows models to make longer term predictions of community dynamics. As more longer term data become available, rigorous tests of model predictions will improve.},

	abstract = {Network approaches have become a popular tool for understanding ecological complexity in a changing world. Many network descriptors relate directly or indirectly to specialization, which is a central concept in ecology and measured in different ways. Unfortunately, quantification of specialization and network structure using field data can suffer from sampling effects. Previous studies evaluating such sampling effects either used field data where the true network structure is unknown, or they simulated sampling based on completely generalized interactions. Here, we used a quantitative niche model to generate bipartite networks representing a wide range of specialization and evaluated potential sampling biases for a large set of specialization and network metrics for different network sizes. We show that with sample sizes realistic for species-rich networks, all metrics are biased towards overestimating specialization (and underestimating generalization and niche overlap). Importantly, this sampling bias depends on the true degree of specialization and is strongest for generalized networks. We show that methods used for empirical data may misrepresent sampling bias: null models simulating generalized interactions may overestimate bias, whereas richness estimators may strongly overestimate sampling completeness. Some network metrics are barely related between small and large sub-samples of the same network and thus may often not be meaningful. Small samples also overestimate interspecific variation of specialization within generalized networks. While new approaches to deal with these challenges have to be developed, we also identify metrics that are relatively unbiased and fairly consistent across sampling intensities and we identify a provisional rule of thumb for the number of observations required for accurate estimates. Our quantitative niche model can help understand variation in network structure capturing both sampling effects and biological meaning. This is needed to connect network science to fundamental ecological theory and to give robust quantitative answers for applied ecological problems.},

Visuomotor response to an approaching object, received as image expansion on insects’ retina, is a complex event in a dynamic environment where both animals and objects are moving. There are intensive free flight studies on the landing response in which insects receive image expansion by their own movement. However, few studies have been conducted regarding how freely flying insects respond to approaching objects. Here, using common laboratory insects for behavioral research, the bumblebee Bombus ignitus, we examined their visual response to an approaching object in the free-flying condition. While the insect was slowly flying in a free-flight arena, an expanding stripe was projected laterally from one side of the arena with a high-speed digital mirror device projector. Rather than turning away reported before, the bumble bees performed complex flight maneuvers. We synchronized flight trajectories, orientations and wing stroke frequencies with projection parameters of temporal resolution in 0.5 ms, and analyzed the instantaneous relationship between visual input and behavioral output. In their complex behavioral responses, we identified the following two visuomotor behaviors: increasing stroke frequency when the bumble bees confront the stripe expansion, and turning towards (not away) the stripe expansion when it is located laterally to the bee. Our results suggested that the response to object expansion is not a simple and reflexive escape but includes object fixation, presumably for subsequent behavioral choice.},

Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many crops and wild flowers, and plans for their conservation require a knowledge of the dynamics and spatial scale of their foraging flights, which are, at present, poorly understood. 2. We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees Bombus terrestris L. on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field. 3. Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees’ destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage. 4. Outward tracks had a mean length of 275·3 ± 18·5 m (n = 65) and a range of 70–631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0·93 ± 0·01 (n = 99). The bees’ ground speeds ranged from 3·0 m s–1 to 15·7 m s–1 (n = 100) in a variety of wind conditions. 5. The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee-pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.},

To control flight, insects rely on the pattern of visual motion generated on the retina as they move through the environment. When light levels fall, vision becomes less reliable and flight control thus becomes more challenging. Here, we investigated the effect of light intensity on flight control by filming the trajectories of free-flying bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Linnaeus 1758) in an experimental tunnel at different light levels. As light levels fell, flight speed decreased and the flight trajectories became more tortuous but the bees were still remarkably good at centring their flight about the tunnel's midline. To investigate whether this robust flight performance can be explained by visual adaptations in the bumblebee retina, we also examined the response speed of the green-sensitive photoreceptors at the same light intensities. We found that the response speed of the photoreceptors significantly decreased as light levels fell. This indicates that bumblebees have both behavioural (reduction in flight speed) and retinal (reduction in response speed of the photoreceptors) adaptations to allow them to fly in dim light. However, the more tortuous flight paths recorded in dim light suggest that these adaptations do not support flight with the same precision during the twilight hours of the day.},

Trait-based analyses of the structure of these networks in highly diversified species assemblages are crucial for improving our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes causing specialization in mutualistic networks. In this study, we assessed the importance of morphological traits for structuring plant-hummingbird networks in Neotropical forests by using a novel combination of quantitative analytical approaches. We recorded the visitation of hummingbirds to plant species over an entire year at three different elevations in Costa Rica and constructed quantitative networks based on interaction frequencies. Three morphological traits were measured in hummingbirds (bill length, bill curvature, and body mass) and plants (corolla length, curvature, and volume). We tested the effects of avian morphological traits and abundance on ecological specialization of hummingbird species. All three morphological traits of hummingbirds were positively associated with ecological specialization, especially bill curvature. We tested whether interaction strength in the networks was associated with the degree of trait matching between corresponding pairs of morphological traits in plant and hummingbird species and explore whether this was related to resource handling times by hummingbird species. We found strong and significant associations between interaction strength and the degree of trait matching. Moreover, the degree of trait matching, particularly between bill and corolla length, was associated with the handling time of nectar resources by hummingbirds. Our findings show that bill morphology structures tropical plant-hummingbird networks and patterns of interactions are closely associated with morphological matches between plant and bird species and the efficiency of hummingbirds' resource use. These results are consistent with the findings of seminal studies in plant-hummingbird systems from the neotropics. We conclude that trait-based analyses of quantitative networks contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of the causes of specialization in ecological networks and could be valuable for studying processes of complementary trait evolution in highly diversified species assemblages.},

	abstract = {Charipinae hyperparasitoids affect effectiveness of the primary parasitoids of aphids by decreasing their abundance and modifying their behavior. As a result, increase of aphid populations can cause severe yield losses in some crops. Therefore, ecological studies on the subfamily Charipinae have a great economical and biological importance. Host specificity of these hyperparasitoids is still under debate and for many Charipinae species very little is known about their trophic relations. Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the trophic relationships between the Charipinae species of the genus Alloxysta Forster and their aphid and primary parasitoids hosts, worldwide. Within this subfamily, Alloxysta arcuata (Kieffer), Alloxysta brevis (Thomson), Alloxysta fuscicornis (Hartig), and Alloxysta victrix (Westwood) are the most generalist species sharing many aphid hosts, while for primary parasitoid hosts these are A. arcuata, A. brevis, Alloxysta pleuralis (Cameron), and A. victrix. Alloxysta citripes (Thomson), Alloxysta halterata (Thomson), Alloxysta leunisii (Hartig), and Alloxysta ramulifera (Thomson) appear, up to now, as the most specialized in relation to the primary parasitoid hosts. Primary parasitoids of the genera Aphidius Nees, Lysiphlebus Forster, Praon Haliday, and Trioxys Haliday are the most common hosts for Alloxysta species, and the common host aphid species belong to the genera Aphis L., Uroleucon Mordvilko, Myzus Passerini, and Sitobion Mordvilko. Host range is analyzed for each Alloxysta species, as well as the extent of overlap between them. We used Jaccard's distance and a hierarchical cluster analysis to determine the host range dissimilarity. A permutation test has been applied to analyze if the host range dissimilarity is significantly different from what is expected by chance. We have calculated additional qualitative measures that complement well the Alloxysta niche overlap analysis and evaluated their host specificity using different indices and bipartite networks.},

	abstract = {Introduced species can have profound direct ecological impacts on native species, yet their potential indirect effects remain relatively unexplored. For instance, introduced predators may directly affect some native species via predation, which may in turn have indirect consequences for other species that are released from competition. We explore this possibility in East Africa's Lake Victoria basin, where the introduction of the predatory Nile perch, Lates niloticus, in the 1950s and 60s contributed to the overall or local extinction of hundreds of native fish by the 1980s. We ask whether this dramatic change in assemblage composition has led to competitive release and niche expansion in Rastrineobola argentea, a resilient native cyprinid that has thrived in this highly perturbed ecosystem. To address this question, we compare the trophic ecology of R.argentea before (1966) and after (2011) the introduction of the Nile perch in Lake Victoria; and across eight satellite lakes that differ in their history of Nile perch invasion. Using this combination of spatial and temporal comparisons, we test for increases in dietary niche breadth (niche expansion) and changes in the level of individual specialisation of R.argentea in invaded versus uninvaded contexts. In our historical comparison, we find good evidence for dietary niche expansion and an increase in interindividual diet variation in R.argentea over time. Across lakes, however, strong bottom-up effects (i.e. variation in prey availability) appear to obscure any potential top-down effects of the Nile perch introduction on the trophic ecology of R.argentea. Overall, we find substantial temporal and spatial variation in the diet and niche breadth of R.argentea, but the underlying drivers remain uncertain, given the complexity of both anthropogenic and natural ecological changes in Lake Victoria over the past century. Understanding both the direct and indirect impacts of introduced species is challenging, but important for successful long-term management of human-altered ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Background: Lake Tanganyika, an ancient lake in the Great Rift Valley, is famous for the adaptive radiation of cichlids. Five tribes of the Cichlidae family have acquired herbivory, with five ecomorphs: grazers, browsers, scrapers, biters and scoopers. Sixteen species of the herbivorous cichlids coexist on a rocky littoral slope in the lake. Seven of them individually defend feeding territories against intruding herbivores to establish algal farms. We collected epiphyton from these territories at various depths and also gathered fish specimens. Algal and cyanobacteria community structures were analysed using the amplicon-metagenomic method. Results: Based on 454-pyrosequencing of SSU rRNA gene sequences, we identified 300 phototrophic taxa, including 197 cyanobacteria, 57 bacillariophytes, and 31 chlorophytes. Algal farms differed significantly in their composition among cichlid species, even in the same ecomorph, due in part to their habitat-depth segregation. The algal species composition of the stomach contents and algal farms of each species differed, suggesting that cichlids selectively harvest their farms. The stomach contents were highly diverse, even between species in the same tribe, in the same feeding ecomorph. Conclusions: In this study, the amplicon-metagenomic approach revealed food niche separation based on habitat-depth segregation among coexisting herbivorous cichlids in the same ecomorphs in Lake Tanganyika.},

A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator \& floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80\%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41\%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36\%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5\%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., similar to 1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Among factors hypothesized to favour consistent individual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality or behavioural types), the social environment has received relatively little attention. Within-group variation in personality may facilitate the emergence of division of labour, if individuals with different personalities tend to specialize on different tasks. In turn, functional benefits derived from division of labour may promote the coexistence of alternative behavioural types. We investigated how intracolonial variation in personality influences individual and collective patterns of task performance in the social spider Anelosimus studiosus. Colonies composed of a mixture of aggressive and docile females showed greater nonreproductive division of labour than monotypic colonies of either behavioural type. Within mixed-personality colonies, aggressive individuals tended to perform more prey capture, colony defence and/or web repair, while docile individuals became brood care specialists. Task differentiation was shaped by social dynamics, but behavioural plasticity varied with personality type: docile individuals were more socially responsive, shifting their task allocation in the presence of aggressive colonymates. Efficiency gains from personality-linked division of labour may help to explain the superior performance of diverse colonies and to maintain individual behavioural variation in A. studiosus and other social species.

We examine levels of reciprocal specialization in an antagonistic system-avian malaria-to determine whether the number of host species used and/or parasite lineages harbored differ between a temperate and a tropical assemblage. We evaluate the results of network analysis, which can incorporate both bird and parasite perspectives on specialization in one quantitative index, in comparison to null models. Specialization was significantly greater in both sample sites than predicted from null models. We found evidence for lower per-host species parasite diversity in temperate compared to tropical birds. However, specialization did not differ between the tropical and temperate sites from the parasite perspective. We supplemented the network analysis with estimates of specialization that incorporate phylogenetic relationships of associates and found no differences between sites. Thus, our analyses indicate that specialization within an antagonistic host-parasite (resource-consumer) system varies little between tropical and temperate localities.},

All networks showed a compartmentalized pattern. There was a positive relation between diet and the diversity of endoparasites. Our analyses also demonstrated that phylogeny and the use of micro-habitat influenced the composition of species of endoparasites and diet pattern of lizards. The principal factor that explained the modularity of the network was the foraging strategy, with segregation between the "active foragers" and "sit-and-wait" lizards. Our analyses also demonstrated that historical (phylogeny) and ecological factors (use of micro-habitat by the lizards) influenced the composition of parasite communities. These results corroborate other studies with ectoparasites, which indicate phylogeny and micro-habitat as determinants in the composition of parasitic fauna. The influence of phylogeny can be the result of coevolution between parasites and lizards in the Caatinga, and the influence of micro-habitat should be a result of adaptations of species of parasites to occupy the same categories of micro-habitats as hosts, thus favoring contagion.},

	abstract = {Complex networks of species interactions might be determined by species traits but also by simple chance meetings governed by species abundances. Although the idea that species traits structure mutualistic networks is appealing, most studies have found abundance to be a major structuring mechanism underlying interaction frequencies. With a well-resolved plant-hummingbird interaction network from the Neotropical savanna in Brazil, we asked whether species morphology, phenology, nectar availability and habitat occupancy and/or abundance best predicted the frequency of interactions. For this, we constructed interaction probability matrices and compared them to the observed plant-hummingbird matrix through a likelihood approach. Furthermore, a recently proposed modularity algorithm for weighted bipartite networks was employed to evaluate whether these factors also scale-up to the formation of modules in the network. Interaction frequencies were best predicted by species morphology, phenology and habitat occupancy, while species abundances and nectar availability performed poorly. The plant-hummingbird network was modular, and modules were associated to morphological specialization and habitat occupancy. Our findings highlight the importance of traits as determinants of interaction frequencies and network structure, corroborating the results of a previous study on a plant-hummingbird network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, we propose that traits matter more in tropical plant-hummingbird networks than in less specialized systems. To test the generality of this hypothesis, future research could employ geographic or taxonomic cross-system comparisons contrasting networks with known differences in level of specialization. Resumo Redes complexas de interacoes entre especies podem ser determinadas pelos atributos das especies, mas tambem meramente pelos encontros aleatorios governados pelas suas abundancias.

Nesse estudo, investigamos uma rede de interacAo entre plantas e beija-flores no Cerrado do Brasil, para compreender se morfologia, fenologia, disponibilidade de nectar, ocupacAo de habitat e/ou abundancia das especies sAo capazes de predizer a frequencia das interacoes na comunidade. Para isso, nos construimos matrizes de probabilidades de interacoes e as comparamos com a matriz de interacAo observada, utilizando analise de verossimilhanca e selecAo de modelos. Alem disso, um algoritmo recentemente proposto para calcular a modularidade em redes bipartidas quantitativas foi utilizado para avaliar se (e como) esses fatores contribuem para a formacAode modulosna rede. A frequencia de interacoes na rede foi melhor predita pela morfologia, fenologia e ocupacAo de habitat, enquanto a abundancia e disponibilidade de nectar tiveram pior desempenho.

	abstract = {Resource specialisation, although a fundamental component of ecological theory, is employed in disparate ways. Most definitions derive from simple counts of resource species. We build on recent advances in ecophylogenetics and null model analysis to propose a concept of specialisation that comprises affinities among resources as well as their co-occurrence with consumers. In the distance-based specialisation index (DSI), specialisation is measured as relatedness (phylogenetic or otherwise) of resources, scaled by the null expectation of random use of locally available resources. Thus, specialists use significantly clustered sets of resources, whereas generalists use over-dispersed resources. Intermediate species are classed as indiscriminate consumers. The effectiveness of this approach was assessed with differentially restricted null models, applied to a data set of 168 herbivorous insect species and their hosts. Incorporation of plant relatedness and relative abundance greatly improved specialisation measures compared to taxon counts or simpler null models, which overestimate the fraction of specialists, a problem compounded by insufficient sampling effort. This framework disambiguates the concept of specialisation with an explicit measure applicable to any mode of affinity among resource classes, and is also linked to ecological and evolutionary processes. This will enable a more rigorous deployment of ecological specialisation in empirical and theoretical studies.},

	abstract = {Exotic species are thought to alter the structure of natural communities and disrupt ecosystem functioning through invasion. Nevertheless, exotic species may also provide ecological insurance when they contribute to maintain ecosystem functions after the decline of native species following anthropogenic disturbance. Here, this hypothesis is tested with the assemblage of frugivorous birds and fleshy-fruited plants of New Zealand, which has suffered strong historical declines in native birds while simultaneously gaining new frugivores introduced by European settlers. We studied the plant-frugivore assemblage from measures of fruit and bird abundances and fruit consumption in nine forest patches, and tested how this changed across a gradient of relative abundance of exotic birds. We then examined how each bird species' role in the assemblage (the proportion of fruits and the number of plant species consumed) varied with their relative abundance, body size and native/exotic status. The more abundant and, to a lesser extent, larger birds species consumed a higher proportion of fruits from more plant species. Exotic birds consumed fruits less selectively and more proportionate to the local availability than did native species. Interaction networks in which exotic birds had a stronger role as frugivores had higher generalization, higher nestedness and higher redundancy of plants. Exotic birds maintained frugivory when native birds became rarer, and diversified the local spectrum of frugivores for co-occurring native plants. These effects seemed related to the fact that species abundances, rather than trait-matching constraints, ultimately determined the patterns of interactions between birds and plants. By altering the structure of plant-frugivore assemblages, exotic birds likely enhance the stability of the community-wide seed dispersal in the face of continued anthropogenic impact.},

In this manuscript, we have studied a global data base of empirical pollination networks to determine whether community, network, species or interaction characteristics can help identify invaded communities. We found that a limited number of community and network properties showed significant differences across the empirical data sets - namely networks with exotic plants present are characterized by greater total, plant and pollinator richness, as well as higher values of relative nestedness. We also observed significant differences in terms of the pollinators that interact with the exotic plants. In particular, we found that specialist pollinators that are also weak contributors to community nestedness are far more likely to interact with exotic plants than would be expected by chance alone.Synthesis. By virtue of their interactions, it appears that exotic plants may provide a key service to a community's specialist pollinators as well as fill otherwise vacant coevolutionary niches'.},

Most of the documented effects of exotic plant species on plant-pollinator interactions have been observational studies using single pairs of native and exotic plants, and have focused on dominant exotic plant species. We know little about how exotic plants alter interactions in entire communities of plants and pollinators, especially at low to medium invader densities. In this study, we began to address these gaps by experimentally removing the flowers of a showy invasive shrub, Rosa multiflora, and evaluating its effects on the frequency, richness, and composition of bee visitors to co-flowering native plants. We found that while R. multiflora increased plot-level richness of bee visitors to co-flowering native plant species at some sites, its presence had no significant effects on bee visitation rate, visitor richness, bee community composition, or abundance overall. In addition, we found that compared to co-flowering natives, R. multiflora was a generalist plant that primarily received visits from generalist bee species shared with native plant species. Our results suggest that exotic plants such as R. multiflora may facilitate native plant pollination in a community context by attracting a more diverse assemblage of pollinators, but have limited and idiosyncratic effects on the resident plant-pollinator network in general.},

The former have been separated into wide and narrow gypsophiles, each with a putative different ecological strategy. Mechanisms displayed by gypsum plants to compete and survive on gypsum are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the main chemical groups in the leaves of plants with different specificity to gypsum soils and to explore the ability of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra analyzed with neural network (NN) modelling to discriminate groups of gypsum plants. Leaf samples of 14 species with different specificity to gypsum soils were analysed with FTIR spectroscopy coupled to neural network (NN) modelling. Spectral data were further related to the N, C, S, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg and ash concentrations of samples. The FTIR spectra of the three groups analyzed showed distinct features that enabled their discrimination through NN models. Wide gypsophiles stood out for the strong presence of inorganic compounds in their leaves, particularly gypsum and, in some species, also calcium oxalate crystals. The spectra of gypsovags had less inorganic chemical species, while those of narrow gypsum endemisms had low inorganics but shared with wide gypsophiles the presence of oxalate. Gypsum and calcium oxalate crystals seem to be widespread amongst gypsum specialist plants, possibly as a way to tolerate excess Ca and sulphate. However, other mechanisms such as the accumulation of sulphates in organic molecules are also compatible with plant specialization to gypsum. While gypsovags seem to be stress tolerant plants that tightly regulate the uptake of S and Ca, the ability of narrow gypsum endemisms to accumulate excess Ca as oxalate may indicate their incipient specialization to gypsum.},

	abstract = {Intertidal mudflats are ecosystems submitted to natural hydrodynamical forcings during each tide. When the offshore water flows at high tide, a proportion of the biofilm produced at low tide can be resuspended in the water column and interact with the pelagic food web. As a consequence, the resuspension creates a link between the benthos and the pelagos, modifying their properties and the stability of the meta-ecosystem they form together. The aim of this study is to describe the consequences of the microbial biofilm resuspension on the pelagic food web, and to investigate the question of the stability of the benthos-pelagos coupling resulting from the biofilm resuspension. Two food webs were considered, corresponding to different hydrodynamical conditions in summer condition: one allowing the biofilm massive resuspension, and one without resuspension, but with particle sedimentation. The Monte-Carlo Markov Chain Linear Modelling was used to estimate the unknown flows of the food web. The comparison of the Ecological Network Analysis indices for the two food webs allowed defining their respective differences of structure and functioning. The results showed that the massive resuspension of the microbial biofilm stimulates pelagic primary production and microbial food web via a higher bacterivory. The higher activity of the whole system coupled with both a drop in the specialisation of the trophic pathways and a low cycling activity demonstrated that when massive resuspension occurs, the system is disturbed. In contrast, when sedimentation occurs, the food webs show functioning features pointing out to a higher stability of the whole system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, due to the paucity of empirical and experimental demonstrations, the genuine importance of each of these drivers in determining trophic niche attributes is not fully appreciated. 2. The present study aimed at determining the population level and individual responses of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to variations in ecological opportunities (terrestrial prey inputs) and autochthonous prey communities among 10 stream reaches along a riparian condition gradient using individual longitudinal monitoring and stable isotope analyses. 3. Our results suggested that trophic niche diversity varied along the environmental gradient, while individual trophic specialization was indirectly driven by ecological opportunities through strengthened intraspecific competition. Individual diet was repeatable over the study period, and the growth rate of juvenile brown trout increased with their specialization for aquatic predatory invertebrates. 4. Our findings highlight the dual influences of intraspecific competition and ecological opportunities on individual trophic specialization and population trophic niche.},

Over 2 y we conducted monthly surveys of fruit patches and medium-to large-bodied vertebrate frugivores within three 100-ha plots (two TF, one VZ), supplemented by fruit surveys along 67 5-km transects distributed across two contiguous forest reserves (41 TF, 26 VZ). Observations of trophic interactions were supplemented by semi-structured interviews with experienced hunters and fishermen from 16 local communities. The resultant binary networks contained low proportions of all potential interactions (TF: 25.7\%, VZ: 19.4\%) between 36 functional groups of frugivores and 152 plant genera and, while we report significant heterogeneity in fruit resource use among broad frugivore guilds within each forest type, recursive partitioning analysis failed to clearly match differences in fruit selection to fruit traits. The annual flood pulse in varzea forests had an overriding influence on the species turnover of both fruit resources and frugivores between the two forest types, with higher-order effects on network structure.},

The understanding of who interacts with whom is a basic information, but the outcomes of interactions among associates are fundamental to draw valid conclusions about the functional structure of the network. Ecological networks studies in general gave little importance to know the true outcomes of interactions and how they may change over time. We evaluate the dynamic of an interaction network between ants and plants with extrafloral nectaries, by verifying the temporal variation in structure and outcomes of mutualism for the plant community (leaf herbivory). To reach this goal, we used two tools: bipartite network analysis and experimental manipulation. The networks exhibited the same general pattern as other mutualistic networks: nestedness, asymmetry and low specialization and this pattern was maintained over time, but with internal changes (species degree, connectance and ant abundance). These changes influenced the protection effectiveness of plants by ants, which varied over time. Our study shows that interaction networks between ants and plants are dynamic over time, and that these alterations affect the outcomes of mutualisms. In addition, our study proposes that the set of single systems that shape ecological networks can be manipulated for a greater understanding of the entire system.},

	abstract = {Compartmentalization-the organization of ecological interaction networks into subsets of species that do not interact with other subsets (true compartments) or interact more frequently among themselves than with other species (modules)-has been identified as a key property for the functioning, stability and evolution of ecological communities. Invasions by entomophilous invasive plants may profoundly alter the way interaction networks are compartmentalized. We analysed a comprehensive dataset of 40 paired plant-pollinator networks (invaded versus uninvaded) to test this hypothesis. We show that invasive plants have higher generalization levels with respect to their pollinators than natives. The consequences for network topology are that-rather than displacing native species from the network-plant invaders attracting pollinators into invaded modules tend to play new important topological roles (i.e. network hubs, module hubs and connectors) and cause role shifts in native species, creating larger modules that are more connected among each other. While the number of true compartments was lower in invaded compared with uninvaded networks, the effect of invasion on modularity was contingent on the study system. Interestingly, the generalization level of the invasive plants partially explains this pattern, with more generalized invaders contributing to a lower modularity. Our findings indicate that the altered interaction structure of invaded networks makes them more robust against simulated random secondary species extinctions, but more vulnerable when the typically highly connected invasive plants go extinct first. The consequences and pathways by which biological invasions alter the interaction structure of plant-pollinator communities highlighted in this study may have important dynamical and functional implications, for example, by influencing multi-species reciprocal selection regimes and coevolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {One consequence of human-driven habitat degradation in general, and habitat fragmentation in particular, is loss of biodiversity. An often-underappreciated aspect of habitat fragmentation relates to changes in the ecology of species that persist in altered habitats. In Bahamian wetlands, ecosystem fragmentation causes disruption of hydrological connectivity between inland fragmented wetlands and adjacent marine areas, with the consequent loss of marine piscivores from fragmented sections. We took advantage of this environmental gradient to investigate effects of ecosystem fragmentation on patterns of resource use in the livebearing fish Gambusia hubbsi (Family Poeciliidae), using both population- and individual-level perspectives. We show that fragmentation-induced release from predation led to increased G. hubbsi population densities, which consequently led to lower mean growth rates, likely as a result of higher intraspecific competition for food. This was accompanied by a broadening of dietary niches via increased interindividual diet variation, suggesting a negative effect of predation and a positive effect of intraspecific competition on the degree of diet variation in natural populations. Our results therefore indicate that habitat fragmentation can greatly impact the ecology of resilient populations, with potentially important ecological and evolutionary implications.},

	abstract = {Recent anthropogenic climate change is strongly associated with average shifts toward earlier seasonal timing of activity (phenology) in temperate-zone species. Shifts in phenology have the potential to alter ecological interactions, to the detriment of one or more interacting species. Recent models predict that detrimental phenological mismatch may increasingly occur between plants and their pollinators. One way to test this prediction is to examine data from ecological communities that experience large annual weather fluctuations. Taking this approach, we analyzed interactions over a four-year period among 132 plant species and 665 pollinating insect species within a Mediterranean community. For each plant species we recorded onset and duration of flowering and number of pollinator species. Flowering onset varied among years, and a year of earlier flowering of a species tended to be a year of fewer species pollinating its flowers. This relationship was attributable principally to early-flowering species, suggesting that shifts toward earlier phenology driven by climate change may reduce pollination services due to phenological mismatch. Earlier flowering onset of a species also was associated with prolonged flowering duration, but it is not certain that this will counterbalance any negative effects of lower pollinator species richness on plant reproductive success. Among plants with different life histories, annuals were more severely affected by flowering pollinator mismatches than perennials. Specialized plant species (those attracting a smaller number of pollinator species) did not experience disproportionate interannual fluctuations in phenology. Thus they do not appear to be faced with disproportionate fluctuations in pollinator species richness, contrary to the expectation that specialists are at greatest risk of losing mutualistic interactions because of climate change.

Here, we use rRNA 16S gene sequencing to assess both the level of parasitism by Aphidiinae primary parasitoids and parasitoid identity on a large sample of aphids collected in cultivated and uncultivated agricultural habitats in Western France. We used these data to construct ecological networks to assess the level of compartmentalization between aphid and parasitoid food webs of cultivated and uncultivated habitats. We evaluated the extent to which uncultivated margins provided a resource for parasitoids shared between pest and nonpest aphids. We compared the observed quantitative ecological network described by our molecular approach to an empirical qualitative network based on aphid-parasitoid interactions from traditional rearing data found in the literature. We found that the molecular network was highly compartmentalized and that parasitoid sharing is relatively rare between aphids, especially between crop and noncrop compartments. Moreover, the few cases of putative shared generalist parasitoids were questionable and could be due to the lack of discrimination of cryptic species or from intraspecific host specialization. Our results suggest that apparent competition mediated by Aphidiinae parasitoids is probably rare in agricultural areas and that the contribution of field margins as a source of these biocontrol agents is much more limited than expected. Further large-scale (spatial and temporal) studies on other crops and noncrop habitats are needed to confirm this.},

Our results showed a clear selection at both taxonomic and functional levels operating in the assembly of the soybean rhizosphere community. The taxonomic analysis revealed that the rhizosphere community is a subset of the bulk soil community. Species abundance in rhizosphere fits the log-normal distribution model, which is an indicator of the occurrence of niche-based processes. In addition, the data indicate that the rhizosphere community is selected based on functional cores related to the metabolisms of nitrogen, iron, phosphorus and potassium, which are related to benefits to the plant, such as growth promotion and nutrition. The network analysis including bacterial groups and functions was less complex in rhizosphere, suggesting the specialization of some specific metabolic pathways. We conclude that the assembly of the microbial community in the rhizosphere is based on niche-based processes as a result of the selection power of the plant and other environmental factors.},

In a microcosm experiment, we investigated ciliate consumer diversity and specialization effects on algal prey biovolume, evenness and composition, and on ciliate biovolume production. The experimental data was complemented by a process-based model further analyzing the ecological mechanisms behind the observed diversity effects. Overall, increasing consumer diversity had no significant effect on prey biovolume or evenness. However, consumer specialization affected the prey community. Specialist consumers showed a stronger negative impact on prey biovolume and evenness than generalists. The model confirmed that this pattern was mainly driven by a single specialist with a high per capita grazing rate, consuming the two most productive prey species. When these were suppressed, the prey assemblage became dominated by a less productive species, consequently decreasing prey biovolume and evenness. Consumer diversity increased consumer biovolume, which was stronger for generalists than for specialists and highest in mixed combinations, indicating that consumer functional diversity, i.e. more diverse feeding strategies, increased resource use efficiency. Overall, our results indicate that consumer diversity effects on prey and consumers strongly depend on species-specific growth and grazing rates, which may be at least equally important as consumer specialization in driving consumer diversity effects across trophic levels.},

Here we trace the evolutionary origin and diversification of Sternarchellini using standard phylogenetic and biogeographic procedures and a dataset of 70 morphological characters. The main results are: 1) the genus Sternarchella includes both species currently assigned to the genus Magosternarchus; and 2) neither of the multi-species assemblages of Sternarchellini in the Amazon and Orinoco basins are monophyletic. Historical biogeographic analysis suggests that sternarchelline evolution was linked to the large-scale river capture event that formed the modern Amazon and Orinoco basins, i.e. the Late Miocene rise of the Vaupes structural arch and concomitant breaching of the Purus structural arch. This event is hypothesized to have contributed to formation of the modern sternarchelline species, and to the formation of the modern basin-wide sternarchelline species assemblages. The results indicate that cladogenesis (speciation) and anagenesis (adaptive evolution) were decoupled processes in the evolution of Sternarchellini.},

	abstract = {Cyrtarachne is an orb-weaving spider belonging to the subfamily Cyrtarachninae (Araneidae) which includes triangular-web-building Pasilobus and bolas spiders. The Cyrtarachninae is a group of spiders specialized in catching moths, which is thought to have evolved from ordinary orb-weaving araneids. Although the web-building time of nocturnal spiders is in general related to the time of sunset, anecdotal evidence has suggested variability of web-building time in Cyrtarachne and its closely related genera. This study has examined the effects of temperature, humidity, moonlight intensity, and prey (moths) availability on web-building time of Cyrtarachne bufo, Cyrtarachne akirai, and Cyrtarachne nagasakiensis. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) have revealed that humidity, and not prey availability, was the essential variable that explained the daily variability of web-building time. Experiments measuring thread stickiness under different humidities showed that, although the thread of Cyrtarachne was found to have strong stickiness under high humidity, low humidity caused a marked decrease of thread stickiness. By contrast, no obvious change in stickiness was seen in an ordinary orb-weaving spider, Larinia argiopiformis. These findings suggest that Cyrtarachne adjusts its web-building time to favorable conditions of high humidity maintaining strong stickiness, which enables the threads to work efficiently for capturing prey.},

	abstract = {Recently several studies have focused on the structure of ecological networks to provide insights into ecological and coevolutionary dynamics of interacting species. However, rarely have the tools of ecological networks been used to understand how feeding relationships vary among individuals of the same population. Here we use 7 years of data and network analyzed to examine the intrapopulation diet variation in a group of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata). We show that individual monkey-resource food webs are nested, but not modular and the stability of these patterns is independent of time of day or season. Our findings indicated that individuals do not forage randomly when compared to null models and that the diets of more selective monkeys represent subsets of the diets of other individuals. Moreover, there are no subgroups that eat a particular set of available plant species more frequently than other sets, suggesting that the spatial strategy of group foraging plays an important role in the feeding ecology of each group given that individuals of the same group tend to share similar resources while the group remains at a feeding site. Since the diets of more selective individuals are a subset of other monkeys, we suggest that more selective monkeys are able to outcompete others for preferred foods. Additionally, we did not observe differences in nutritional content or spatial abundance of more frequently eaten plant species when compared with less frequently eaten species, but in most cases, the more frequently eaten plant species were Ficus (Moraceae). This reinforces the important role that Ficus trees play in howler monkey feeding ecology, likely due to its year-round availability. Am. J. Primatol. 76:670-678, 2014.

The results of the combined data indicate an increase in connectance in relation to animal-centered networks and differences in the mean degree for plants and animals, showing the importance of complementary methods of collecting data to reduce the sampling biases of each isolated method. The nestedness level was most time significant and higher in the animal-centered networks. Our work shows that the apparently specialist behavior of some visitor species may be in part circumvented with the supplementation of plant-centered data with animal-centered data, thereby leading to a result closer to that expected by theory, which predicts a more generalist behavior.},

At the same time, the role of predators in the evolution of herbivore dietary specialization has been an unresolved issue in evolutionary ecology. Here, we integrate these perspectives by testing the role of herbivore diet breadth as a predictor of top-down effects of avian predators on herbivores and plants in a forest food web. Using experimental bird exclosures to study a complex community of trees, caterpillars, and birds, we found a robust positive association between caterpillar diet breadth (phylodiversity of host plants used) and the strength of bird predation across 41 caterpillar and eight tree species. Dietary specialization was associated with increased enemy-free space for both camouflaged (n = 33) and warningly signaled (n = 8) caterpillar species. Furthermore, dietary specialization was associated with increased crypsis (camouflaged species only) and more stereotyped resting poses (camouflaged and warningly signaled species), but was unrelated to caterpillar body size. These dynamics in turn cascaded down to plants: a metaanalysis (n = 15 tree species) showed the beneficial effect of birds on trees (i.e., reduced leaf damage) decreased with the proportion of dietary specialist taxa composing a tree species' herbivore fauna. We conclude that herbivore diet breadth is a key functional trait underlying the trophic effects of carnivores on both herbivores and plants.},

Flowering communities offer their pollinators varying numbers and proportions of floral resources, and the uniformity observed in these floral resources is, to some degree, due to shared ancestry. Here, we find that pollinators visit related plant species more so than expected by chance throughout 29 plant-pollinator networks of varying sizes, with "clade specialization" increasing with community size. As predicted, less versatile pollinators showed more clade specialization overall. We then asked whether this clade specialization varied with the ratio of pollinator species to plant species such that pollinators were changing their behavior when there was increased competition (and presumably a forced narrowing of the realized niche) by examining pollinators that were present in at least three of the networks. Surprisingly, we found little evidence that variation in clade specialization is caused by pollinator species changing their behavior in different community contexts, suggesting that clade specialization is observed when pollinators are either restricted in their floral choices due to morphological constraints or innate preferences. The resulting pollinator sharing between closely related plant species could result in selection for greater pollinator specialization.},

	abstract = {Most network studies on biological interactions consider only a single interaction type. However, individual species are simultaneously positioned in various types of interactions. The ways in which different network types are merged and entangled, and the variations in network structures between different sympatric networks, require full elucidation. Incorporating interaction types and disentangling complex networks is crucial, because the integration of various network architectures has the potential to alter the stability and co-evolutionary dynamics of the whole network. To reveal how different types of interaction networks are entangled, we focused on the interaction between birds and flowers of temperate plants in Japan, where flower-feeding birds are mainly generalist passerines, acting as pollinators and predators of flowers. Using long-term monitoring data, we investigated the flower-feeding episodes of birds. We constructed the whole network (WN) between birds and plants, separating the network into mutualistic and antagonistic sub-networks (MS and AS, respectively). We investigated structural properties of the three quantified networks and species-level characteristics of the main bird species. For bird species, we evaluated dietary similarity, dietary specialization and shifts of feeding behaviour relative to plant traits. Our results indicate that WN comprises entangled MS and AS, sharing considerable proportions of bird and plant assemblages. We observed distinctive differences in the network structural properties between the two sub-networks. In comparison with AS, MS had lower numbers of bird and plant species, showed lower specialization and modularity and exhibited higher nestedness. At the species level, the Japanese white-eye acted as pollinator, while the brown-eared bulbul acted as both pollinator and predator for large numbers of flowers, based on its behavioural plasticity. Overall, the pattern of avian feeding behaviour was influenced by flower size and plant origin. Birds showed nectarivory for plants with medium-sized flowers and exotic origins. Our results highlight the complex patterns of interactions between birds and the flowers of plants in temperate regions. They also indicate that understanding the interaction type for each species pair and consideration of the behavioural plasticity of animal species are important for elucidating integrated network structures.},

However, the mechanisms underlying such biodiversity effects remain poorly explored, as mostly effects of species richness - a very basic biodiversity measure - have been studied. Here, we analyze to what extent the functional and phylogenetic diversity of woody plant communities affect herbivory along a diversity gradient in a subtropical forest. We assessed the relative effects of morphological and chemical leaf traits and of plant phylogenetic diversity on individual-level variation in herbivory of dominant woody plant species across 27 forest stands in south-east China. Individual-level variation in herbivory was best explained by multivariate, community-level diversity of leaf chemical traits, in combination with community-weighted means of single traits and species-specific phylodiversity measures. These findings deviate from those based solely on trait variation within individual species. Our results indicate a strong impact of generalist herbivores and highlight the need to assess food-web specialization to determine the direction of biodiversity effects. With increasing plant species loss, but particularly with the concomitant loss of functional and phylogenetic diversity in these forests, the impact of herbivores will probably decrease - with consequences for the herbivore-mediated regulation of ecosystem functions.},

Here we studied how abundance fluctuations (i.e. demographic and stochastic population dynamics in one of the trophic levels) may affect derived network-level inferences in bipartite ecological networks. Variation at both the species and network level in network indices (d', Dependence, Fisher's alpha diversity for both levels, H-2', weighted NODF) were strongly correlated with the extent of abundance fluctuations, with a strong effect of environmental stochasticity on all indices except NODF; this was the only index for which considerable variation was caused by varying carrying capacities among species. Binary connectance, in turn, does not take interaction frequency (and thus abundance) into account and was only influenced by abundance fluctuations at low population sizes if this led to non-occurrence of 'true' interactions. Overall, abundance and population dynamics are likely to play an important role in determining what is commonly observed and summarized into ecological networks. We suggest that ecological network inference should account for underlying population dynamics and uncertainty in what is observed as interaction frequencies, modelling mechanisms at operative organisational levels below the network rather than using aggregated data of observations. Modelling population dynamics may be a valuable tool in this field to conceptualize and tease apart different sources of variation and express uncertainty in our inference from small samples.},

Mangroves are dominated by a few tree species and there are potentially few resource axes available for partitioning by terrestrial birds. Competition for limited resources is predicted to cause strong niche differentiation and a highly structured, but low diversity, bird assemblage. Using multivariate and bipartite network analyses based on 1771 foraging observations (33\% of 5320 behavioral observations), we examined resource partitioning by 20 terrestrial bird species in mangroves of north Australia. The mangrove bird community largely comprised generalist insectivores that partitioned insects by size with moderate-to-high interspecific overlap in diet. Gleaning for insects was the most common foraging mode. Few species specialized on nectar. Flowers of one or more mangrove species were available in every month of the year and insect abundance was correlated with flowering peaks. Niche differentiation by birds was determined by food type and foraging mode more than by broad spatial (mangrove zones) or temporal (seasonal) segregation of the use of resources. There was little evidence of bird species saturation or species sorting, suggesting loose species packing and a lesser role than expected for species interactions and interference competition in structuring the bird assemblage in mangroves.},

	abstract = {One of the most noticeable effects of anthropogenic climate change is the shift in timing of seasonal events towards earlier occurrence. The high degree of variation in species' phenological shifts has raised concerns about the temporal decoupling of interspecific interactions, but the extent and implications of this effect are largely unknown. In the case of plant-pollinator systems, more specialized species are predicted to be particularly threatened by phenological decoupling, since they are assumed to be less flexible in the choice of interaction partners, but until now this hypothesis has not been tested. In this paper, we studied phenology and interactions of plant and pollinator communities along an altitudinal gradient in the Alps as a model for the possible effects of climate change in time. Our results show that even relatively specialized pollinators were much more flexible in their use of plant species as floral resources than their local flower visitation suggested. We found no relationship between local specialization of pollinators and the consistency of their visitation patterns across sites, and also no relationship between specialization and phenological synchrony of pollinators with particular plants. Thus, in contrast to the conclusions of a recent simulation study, our results suggest that most pollinator species included in this study are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants. However, the flexibility of many rarely observed pollinator species remains unknown. Moreover, our results suggest that specialized flower visitors select plant species based on certain floral traits such as the length of the nectar holder tube. If that is the case, the observed flexibility of plant-pollinator interactions likely depends on a high degree of functional redundancy in the plant community, which may not exist in less diverse systems.},

The analysis of interaction networks is a useful tool for estimating the degree of change experienced by ecosystems. Here, plant-floral visitor networks from fragments of grassland restored by agricultural activities discontinued over a long time were compared with networks from agriculturalized fragments nearby. The hypothesis evaluated was that land use intensification changes the structure of the original networks by modifying species richness and the network degree of specialization. The study was carried out at three sites located over a 700 km transect across the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa, Argentina. At each site, four fragments were selected (two restored and two agricultural). Five monthly samplings were taken between November and March along three consecutive years. Entomophilous plants and their floral visitors were identified and all plant-floral visitor interactions were recorded. With these data, richness of plants and visitors were calculated, interaction networks were constructed and the degree of specialization was calculated for each network. Land use intensification caused changes in the community composition and degree of specialization. When cropping was the predominant farming enterprise, richness of floral visitors and plants decreased as compared to restored fragments. When cattle production was the predominant land use, richness of floral visitors remained stable. However, at one of the sites plants richness was 48\% higher in the grazed fragments than in those restored. In the agricultural fragments, the abundance of units of floral attraction due to exotic plants increased, but the visitation rates were the same as in the restored fragments. The networks in the agricultural fragments were more generalist than in restored fragments, in agreement with previous studies on the effect of land use intensification on natural systems.

Despite recent progress, our understanding of the effects of insularity on other components of biodiversity, e.g. the diversity of species interactions, is still poorly developed. In this study, we investigated the effect of insularity on the structure of seed-dispersal networks on a global scale. Location World-wide. Methods We compiled a large dataset of seed-dispersal networks (n = 28). We (1) compared the diversity (interaction evenness, complementary specialization) and asymmetry (web asymmetry, interaction strength asymmetry) of interactions between island and mainland networks, and (2) tested the effects of island area and isolation on the four network metrics. Results Neither measure of interaction diversity differed between islands and the mainland. In contrast, island networks were more asymmetric than mainland networks, due to a paucity of animal frugivores, especially birds. Both measures of network asymmetries were closely associated with island isolation, but were unrelated to island area. Patterns were consistent in analyses with and without non-native plant and animal species. Main conclusions Because of the highly asymmetric structure of seed-dispersal networks on islands, plant species on islands are highly dependent on particular animal species. These asymmetries probably arise from low rates of colonization and high rates of human-caused extinction of frugivorous animals on isolated islands. Although interaction evenness and specialization were similar between islands and the mainland, additional work is needed to test whether high asymmetries will make island networks more vulnerable to future change and functional collapse.},

Although there is some evidence of less complex interaction networks on oceanic islands, only a few studies have compared island communities with each other or with mainland communities. Here, we analyse the species composition and structural properties of quantitative flower visitation networks in two communities of each of two different island systems: the Canary Islands (oceanic origin) and the Balearic Islands (continental origin). We compared different network parameters to inform us about their vulnerability in the face of different types of disturbance. The number of species was greater in the Balearic than in the Canarian networks but, contrary to expectations, the total number and diversity of interactions did not differ between them. Moreover, a greater number of opportunistic species and the presence of super-generalist species on the oceanic island led to significantly higher values of quantitative connectance and nestedness relative to those on the continental island. Given that these two parameters are associated with network stability, our findings support the hypothesis that oceanic island communities are less vulnerable to perturbations than are those of continental islands, although further studies with a network approach are needed to determine whether this is a general pattern.

	abstract = {The niche variation hypothesis (NVH) predicts that populations with wider niches are phenotypically more variable than populations with narrower niches, which is frequently used to explain diversifying processes such as ecological release. However, not all empirical evidence supports the NVH. Furthermore, a relationship between population phenotypic variation and niche width can be caused by sexual selection or environmental gradients, which should be carefully considered along with competition in explaining niche variation. In this study, we used eight populations of a generalist passerine species, Paradoxornis webbianus (vinous-throated parrotbill), to test the NVH. We assessed evidence of ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental gradients in bill morphology of P.webbianus. A total of 170 P.webbianus from eight sites ranging 24-2668m in altitude were included in this study. We used two principal components to quantify bill morphology: one describes bill size and the other describes bill slenderness. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of bird feathers to quantify trophic positions, and we estimated population trophic niche width using Bayesian standardized ellipse area. Paradoxornis webbianus with larger and more slender bills fed at higher trophic levels and population trophic niche width tended to increase with bill-size variation, supporting the NVH. The males had larger bills and marginally higher nitrogen isotope values than the females, suggesting ecological sexual dimorphism. Despite a positive correlation between bill size and wing length indicating sexual selection for larger male size, only three of the eight populations showed both male-biased bill size and male-biased wing length. Sexual dimorphism explained 13\%-64\% of bill-size variation across sites, suggesting its role in niche variation could vary greatly among populations. The variation in bill slenderness in P.webbianus increased with elevation. However, neither bill-size variation nor trophic niche width changed with elevation. Therefore, environmental gradients that could be reflected in the elevation are not likely to drive the observed morphological and niche variation. This study provides an empirical case for the NVH and highlights the importance of investigating sexual dimorphism and environmental gradients in studies of niche dynamics.},

	abstract = {Adaptive speciation can occur when a population undergoes assortative mating and disruptive selection caused by frequency-dependent intraspecific competition. However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness. These results hold after the relaxation of various assumptions. When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, and in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems. Hence, different processes, such as trait convergence favoring the incorporation of nonrelated species, are needed to explain the higher richness of low-intimacy assemblagesshown here to be up to 1 order of magnitude richer than high-intimacy systems.},

	abstract = {The concept of keystone individuals offers a unifying framework to study the evolution and persistence of individuals that have a disproportionately large, irreplaceable effect on group dynamics. Although the literature is teeming with examples of these individuals, disparate terminologies have impeded a major synthesis of this topic across fields. To allow a strict classification of potential keystone individuals, we offer herein some general terminology, outline practical methodological approaches to distinguish between keystone individuals and generic individuals that only occupy a keystone role, and propose ways to measure the effect of keystones on group dynamics. In particular, we suggest that keystone individuals should be classified as 'fixed' or 'episodic' according to the duration of time over which they impact their group. We then venture into the existing literature to identify distinctive keystone roles that generic and/or keystone individuals can occupy in a group (e.g. dominant individual, leader or superspreader), and describe traits that can give rise to keystone individuals. To highlight the ecological implications, we briefly review some of the effects that keystone individuals can have on their group and how this could affect other levels of organization such as populations and communities. In looking at their diverse evolutionary origins, we discuss key mechanisms that could explain the presence of keystone individuals. These mechanisms include traditional Darwinian selection on keystone-conferring genotypes, experience and state- .or context-dependent effects. We close our review by discussing various opportunities for empirical and theoretical advancement and outline concepts that will aid future studies on keystone individuals.

The magnitude of these impacts, however, may be modified by the relative abundance of the invasive plant and the number of flowers it presents. 2. We tested this by examining the structure of insect flower interaction networks in six sites with increasing levels of invasion by Rhododendron ponticum in Ireland. 3. Neither flower-visiting insect abundance, species richness nor diversity were related to R. ponticum flower abundance, but the composition of insect communities was. The total number of flowers in a site increased with the relative abundance of R. ponticum flowers but the number of co-flowering native plant species in these sites was low ({\textless}6), making interaction networks relatively small. 4. As a result,,changes in interaction network properties (connectance, interaction evenness and network level specialisation), which correlated with R. ponticum flower abundance, were a result of the small network size rather than due to changes in the resilience of networks. 5. Overall, we conclude that the impacts of invasive alien plants on native plant-pollinator interactions are not only species specific, but site specific, according to the abundance of flowers produced by both the invasive and the native plants.

Species-specific plant and pollinator responses to land use were significantly predicted by the weighted average land-use response of each species' partners. Moreover, more specialized pollinators were more vulnerable than generalists. Both predictions are based on the relative interaction strengths provided by the observed interaction network. Losses in flower and pollinator diversity were linked, and mutual dependence between plants and pollinators accelerates the observed parallel declines in response to land-use intensification.

In a seasonal desert of northwestern Argentina, we surveyed the richness and phenology of EFN plants and their associated ants and examined the patterns in ant-plant interaction networks. We found that 25 ant species and 11 EFN-bearing plant species were linked together through 96 pairs of associations. Plants bearing EFNs were abundant, representing ca. 19 \% of the species encountered in transects and 24 \% of the plant cover. Most ant species sampled (ca. 77 \%) fed on EF nectar. Interactions showed a marked seasonal pattern: EFN secretion was directly related to plant phenology and correlated with the time of highest ant ground activity. Our results reveal that EFN-mediated interactions are ecologically relevant components of deserts, and that EFN-bearing plants are crucial for the survival of desert ant communities.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic interactions are the functional basis of ecological communities. One of the most important mutualistic interactions is pollination, such as between hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and many plant species. The hummingbird-plant interactions can be better understood by the use of mutualistic networks approach. Through this approach we can define, for example, key species of a community and the effect that its extinction can cause in such community. Despite of its ecological importance, several aspects of hummingbird-plant mutualistic networks are unknown, e.g., if key species are similar between different spatial scales. In this paper, we determined at two spatial scales (landscape and vegetation type) the degree of specialization of such networks, and dependence and asymmetry of interacting species of hummingbird-plant mutualistic networks at Metztitlan Ravine Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. During one year of systematic sampling, we recorded eight hummingbird species and 27 species of plants visited by them at landscape level. The degree of specialization as well as the values of dependence and asymmetry indicate that each vegetation type has different key species, and that some of these species are key species at landscape level, too. Cynanthus latirostris and Hylocharis leucotis were the key hummingbirds species at landscape level, while C. latirostris and Calothorax lucifer were key species for Submontane Scrub and H. leucotis for Oak Forest and Pine-Oak Forest. The key plant species at landscape level were Pachycereus marginatus and Salvia Mexicana while P. marginatus was important for Submontane Scrub, Cirsium ehrembergii for Pine-Oak Forest, and S. mexicana and S. microphylla were important for Oak forest. Our results suggest that the spatial level of analysis determines the identity of the key species in hummingbird-plant mutualistic networks, which must be taken into account when aiming at the conservation of such networks in a landscape.},

The description of the craniodental remains and the analysis of their variability indicate a marked sexual dimorphism, most probably induced by sex differential growth, helping to reassess the specific diversity of Libycosaurus and its main evolutionary trends in a phylogenetic perspective. The ecological niche occupied by the new species was also further characterized in its semiaquatic, behavioural, and dietary dimensions. On these grounds we suggest that Late Miocene environmental changes, particularly habitat opening and hydrographic network fragmentation related to increased aridity, played a major role in canalizing semi-aquatic specializations and the extinction of the last African anthracotheres, as well as other bothriodontines.},

Focal species of the host list were Thuja plicata, Buxus sempervirens and Prunus laurocerasus, the selection being based on reported bestselling figures. Bipartite, qualitative, undirected networks were constructed to incorporate woody perennials as hosts and their documented pathogens. The tested network properties were: connectance, node degree distribution, web asymmetry and nestedness. Cluster analysis using Euclidian distance and niche overlap index of Pianka were employed as additional pattern description metrics. The main network containing 33 host species and 112 pathogens was characterized by truncated power law distribution fitting the observed degree distribution of hosts and power law distribution fitting the observed degree distribution of pathogens, low connectance (C = 0.12), intermediate web asymmetry (W = 0.54) and high significant nestedness (N = 0.94). The network containing three focal hosts showed significant lower nestedness (N = 0.54), higher asymmetry (W = 0.94) and higher connectance (C = 0.38). Cluster analysis revealed the separation of focal species distinctly, the majority of other hosts merging in one cluster. Due to the prevalence of specialized pathogens the niche breadth was narrow, with small overlap in resources' partition (Pianka index = 0.31). Our results showed that a random assembly of hosts (woody ornamentals displayed for sale in retail centers and nurseries) could harbor pathogens which attached in a non-random manner, generating a characteristic pathosystem, with distinctive topology.

Here we argue that, in general, results from meta-analyses should not discourage researchers from investigating the reasons for the lack of clear patterns, thus proposing a few tentative explanations to the fact that species-area relationships are infrequent or at least difficult to be detected in most host-parasite systems. The peculiar structure of host-parasite networks, the enemy release hypothesis, the possible discrepancy between host and parasite ranges, and the evolutionary tendency of parasites towards specialization may explain why the observed patterns often do not fit those predicted by species-area relationships.},

	abstract = {Ecological segregation among coexisting seabird species can occur due to morphological and behavioral differences. This segregation is especially important as it reduces competition during the breeding season, when birds are central-place foragers. Furthermore, seasonal variation in oceanographic processes may change prey availability and shape seabird community trophic structure and species isotopic niche. We used stable isotope analyses of seabird whole blood and prey muscle in 5 tropical seabird communities representing 12 species (Charadriiformes, Phaethontiformes, Procellariiformes and Suliformes) inhabiting 5 offshore islands off Brazil from 00 degrees 55' N to 20 degrees 30' S and 65 to 1160 km from the coast. We evaluated how community trophic structure was correlated with morphology (body mass and bill length), and we verified seasonal variation in isotopic niche in 2 communities. Overall, seabird trophic position (TP) was positively correlated with body size, with frigatebirds and boobies occupying a higher TP than noddies and terns. Structuring of seabird communities according to body size probably occurred due to consumption of prey of different sizes and TP, which contributed to niche segregation by reducing interspecific competition during the breeding season. All species showed isotopic niche segregation at 2 islands, and similar to 60 to 70\% of species segregated at the other islands, except at Atol das Rocas, where 43\% of species segregated. Niche overlap occurred mainly among closely related species at Atol das Rocas, Fernando de Noronha and Trindade. The isotopic niche and TP changed across islands for all 3 boobies (red-footed Sula sula, brown S. leucogaster and masked S. dactylatra), brown noddy Anous stolidus and red-billed tropicbird Phaethon aethereus; these factors also changed seasonally in other species, such as in magnificent frigatebird Fregata magnificens, brown booby, both the red-billed P. aethereus and white-tailed P. lepturus tropicbirds and both the brown A. stolidus and black Anous minutus noddies. Such changes probably occurred due to differences in prey availability, opportunistic behavior (e.g. feeding on fishery discards) and/or local foraging and diet specialization.},

	abstract = {Understanding how natural and anthropogenic drivers affect extant food webs is critical to predicting the impacts of climate change and habitat alterations on ecosystem dynamics. In the Florida Everglades, seasonal reductions in freshwater flow and precipitation lead to annual migrations of aquatic taxa from marsh habitats to deep-water refugia in estuaries. The timing and intensity of freshwater reductions, however, will be modified by ongoing ecosystem restoration and predicted climate change. Understanding the importance of seasonally pulsed resources to predators is critical to predicting the impacts of management and climate change on their populations. As with many large predators, however, it is difficult to determine to what extent predators like bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in the coastal Everglades make use of prey pulses currently. We used passive acoustic telemetry to determine whether shark movements responded to the pulse of marsh prey. To investigate the possibility that sharks fed on marsh prey, we modelled the predicted dynamics of stable isotope values in bull shark blood and plasma under different assumptions of temporal variability in shark diets and physiological dynamics of tissue turnover and isotopic discrimination. Bull sharks increased their use of upstream channels during the late dry season, and although our previous work shows long-term specialization in the diets of sharks, stable isotope values suggested that some individuals adjusted their diets to take advantage of prey entering the system from the marsh, and as such this may be an important resource for the nursery. Restoration efforts are predicted to increase hydroperiods and marsh water levels, likely shifting the timing, duration and intensity of prey pulses, which could have negative consequences for the bull shark population and/or induce shifts in behaviour. Understanding the factors influencing the propensity to specialize or adopt more flexible trophic interactions will be an important step in fully understanding the ecological role of predators and how ecological roles may vary with environmental and anthropogenic changes.},

Combining our own measurements with published data, we established that the trophic positions of mite species were remarkably stable within and among forests, as well as between ambient and experimental N deposition. Trophic stability indicates a higher than expected level of feeding specialization, which may foster diversity, but limit the ability to switch food resources in a changing environment.

Stable isotope and fatty acid signatures differ between aquatic and terrestrial food webs, and therefore can be used to assess the aquatic and terrestrial contributions to the diets of species. We studied faecal samples of three co-occurring bat species with known differences in feeding preferences. The aim was to assess whether stable isotope and fatty acid signatures of faeces can be used to determine feeding preferences. We used bat faeces because they can be easily and non-invasively collected. We hypothesised that faeces stable isotope and fatty acid signatures will reveal the terrestrial, aquatic and mixed feeding niches of Myotis myotis, M. daubentonii, and M. mystacinus, respectively. As predicted, the faeces of M. myotis were characterized by higher delta C-13 values and higher concentrations of linoleic acid and total omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are typically higher in terrestrial food webs. The faeces of M. daubentonii had higher delta N-15 values and higher concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid and total omega 3 PUFAs, characteristic features of aquatic systems. Myotis mystacinus faeces had intermediate delta N-15 values and concentrations of both types of fatty acids. Our results show that analysing stable isotope and/or fatty acid signatures of faeces provides a promising, non-invasive tool to study the feeding ecology of bats and to assess aquatic-terrestrial interactions.},

Ethnographic studies have reported that their diets differ in consumption of both animal proteins and starch grains. Hunted meat and gathered plant foods, especially underground storage organs (USOs), are dietary staples for pygmies. However, scarce information exists about forager-farmer interaction and the agricultural products used by pygmies. Since the effects of dietary preferences on teeth in modern and past pygmies remain unknown, we explored dietary history through quantitative analysis of buccal microwear on cheek teeth in well-documented Baka pygmies. We then determined if microwear patterns differ among other Pygmy groups (Aka, Mbuti, and Babongo) and between Bantu-speaking farmer and pastoralist populations from past centuries. The buccal dental microwear patterns of Pygmy hunter-gatherers and non-Pygmy Bantu pastoralists show lower scratch densities, indicative of diets more intensively based on nonabrasive foodstuffs, compared with Bantu farmers, who consume larger amounts of grit from stoneground foods. The Baka pygmies showed microwear patterns similar to those of ancient Aka and Mbuti, suggesting that the mechanical properties of their preferred diets have not significantly changed through time. In contrast, Babongo pygmies showed scratch densities and lengths similar to those of the farmers, consistent with sociocultural contacts and genetic factors. Our findings support that buccal microwear patterns predict dietary habits independent of ecological conditions and reflect the abrasive properties of preferred or fallback foods such as USOs, which may have contributed to the dietary specializations of ancient human populations.},

Poor diet resolution from stomach content analysis often impairs the ability to assess differences in inter- and intra-population trophodynamics and therefore understand resource partitioning among deep-sea fishes. Antimora rostrata (predator-scavenger), Coryphaenoides armatus (predator-scavenger), Coryphaenoides brevibarbis (predator) and Halosauropsis macrochir (predator) were collected from 3 stations on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in 2007 and 2009 to investigate trophic ecology using delta C-13 and delta N-15. Variability in lipid-normalised delta C-13 (delta C-13(n)) and delta N-15 was explained by body length in all species but slope and significance of the isotope-length relationships varied both temporally and spatially. 815N increases with length were observed in A. rostrata at all stations, C brevibarbis and H. macrochir at one or more stations but were absent in C. armatus. delta C-13(n), increased with length in A. rostrata but the slope of delta C-13(n)-length relationships varied spatially and temporally in C. armatus and C. brevibarbis. The co-occurring delta C-13(n), and delta N-15 size-based trends in A. rostrata and H. macrochir suggested that size-based trends were a result of increasing trophic position. In C. armatus and C. brevibarbis the isotope-length trends were difficult to distinguish among trophic position increases, shifts in resource use i.e. benthic to pelagic or internal physiology. However, the overall strength, direction and significance of isotope-length trends varied temporally and spatially which suggested varying degrees of overlap in trophic ecology and feeding plasticity among these species.

Several studies have typified species of echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks as the most important herbivores and carnivores of intertidal assemblages. Unfortunately, little is known about the diet and behavior of many consumers, making difficult addressing key issues related to the importance of omni vory, intra-and inter-specific competition, or individual specialization. The goal of this paper is to fill some gaps in the available information and provide researchers with an exhaustive dietary analysis and relevant ecological descriptors for a suite of 30 consumer species distributed along the southeastern Pacific coast. Our data integrate information collected through seasonal samplings conducted between 2004 and 2007 at 4 localities distributed over 1,000 km of coast in northern Chile. Based on laboratory and field work analysis, we present: (a) a consumer-resource matrix obtained from high-resolution analyses of gut contents of 6,377 individuals, including 222 prey items (80\% identified at species or genus level); (b) estimates of the density, body size (length and weight), diet width (at individual and species levels), and within-individual diversity of consumer species; (c) an nMDS ordination of the compositional similarity of consumers' diets, and information on the relative importance and occurrence frequency of the most common preys of each consumer. Based on the high frequency of omnivory and the high diet overlap among consumers, we discuss their potential for competition and the role of individual specialization in shaping their generalist character, highlighting the need to reappraise their behavior and ecological effects in the intertidal community.},

Although we have a general understanding of the negative consequences of habitat loss for biodiversity, much less is known about the resulting effects on the pattern of interactions in mutualistic networks. Ecological networks formed by mutualistic interactions often exhibit a highly nested architecture with low modularity, especially in comparison with antagonistic networks. These patterns of interaction are thought to confer stability on mutualistic communities. With the growing threat of environmental change, it is important to expand our understanding of the factors that affect biodiversity and the stability of the communities that provide critical ecosystem functions and services. We studied the effects of habitat loss on plant-pollinator network architecture and found that regional habitat loss contributes directly to species loss and indirectly to the reorganization of interspecific interactions in a local community. Networks became more highly connected and more modular with habitat loss. Species richness and abundance were the primary drivers of variation in network architecture, though species compositi n affected modularity. Theory suggests that an increase in modularity with habitat loss will threaten community stability, which may contribute to an extinction debt in communities already affected by habitat loss.},

Microbe-host symbiotic associations are poorly explored in comparison with other species interaction networks. The current paradigm on symbiosis research stems from species-poor systems where pairwise and reciprocally specialized interactions between a single microbe and a single host that coevolve are the norm. These symbioses involving just a few species are fascinating in their own right, but more diverse and complex host-associated microbial communities are increasingly found, with new emerging questions that require new paradigms and approaches. Here we adopt an intermediate complexity approach to study the specificity, phylogenetic community structure, and temporal variability of the subset of the most abundant bacteria associated with different sponge host species with diverse eco-evolutionary characteristics. We do so by using a monthly resolved annual temporal series of host-associated and free-living bacteria. Bacteria are very abundant and diverse within marine sponges, and these symbiotic interactions are hypothesized to have a very ancient origin. We show that host-bacteria reciprocal specialization depends on the temporal scale and level of taxonomic aggregation considered. Sponge hosts with similar eco-evolutionary characteristics (e.g., volume of tissue corresponding to microbes, water filtering rates, and microbial transmission type) have similar bacterial phylogenetic community structure when looking at interactions aggregated over time. In general, sponge hosts hypothesized to form more intricate relationships with bacteria show a remarkably persistent bacterial community over time. Other hosts, however, show a large turnover similar to that observed for free-living bacterioplankton. Our study highlights the importance of exploring temporal variability in host-microbe interaction networks if we aim to determine how specific and persistent these poorly explored but extremely common interactions are.},

	abstract = {Both ecological and evolutionary timescales are of importance when considering an ecological system; population dynamics affect the evolution of species traits, and vice versa. Recently, these two timescales have been used to explain structural patterns in host-parasite networks, where the evolution of the manner in which species balance the use of their resources in interactions with each other was examined. One of these patterns was nestedness, in which the set of parasite species within a particular host forms a subset of those within a more species-rich host. Patterns of both nestedness and anti-nestedness have been observed significantly more often than expected due to chance in host-parasite networks. In contrast, mutualistic networks tend to display a significant degree of nestedness, but are rarely anti-nested. Within networks with different interaction types, therefore, there appears to be a feature promoting non-random structural patterns, such as nestedness and anti-nestedness, depending on the interaction types involved. Here, we invoke the co-evolution of species trait-values when allocating resources to interactions to explain the structural pattern of nestedness in a mutualistic community. We look at a bipartite, multi-species system, in which the strength of an interaction between two species is determined by the resources that each species invests in that relationship. We then analyze the evolution of these interactions using adaptive dynamics. We found that the evolution of these interactions, reflecting the trade-off of resources, could be used to accurately predict that nestedness occurs significantly more often than expect due to chance alone in a mutualistic network. This complements previous results applying the same concept to an antagonistic network. We conclude that population dynamics and resource trade-offs could be important promoters of structural patterns in ecological networks of different types.},

	abstract = {Plant-animal mutualistic interactions such as frugivory and seed dispersal display great variation in time due to fluctuations in fruit abundance, animal abundance, and behavior. In particular, some species participate in interactions with other species only transiently, while other species are active for longer periods of time. Species with a longer period of activity are able to interact with more species, and thus engage in constant participation in an interaction network. Species with high constancy would thus be expected to help maintain the biodiversity of a community; however, the manner in which constant species link to their partners may be critical to species coexistence. Because species that interact with many partners concurrently could create more competition compared to those species that interact sequentially with many partners, evaluating the concurrence in an interaction network sheds light on how the network can maintain biodiversity. In this study, we investigate how phenological patterns of fruit production and frugivore presence affect the temporal variation of a plant-frugivore network, and focus on the manner in which high degree species collect their interactions over time. We found a clear separation of activity periods: most species appeared only briefly and participated in relatively few interactions, or showed activity for longer time periods and participated in more interactions. Species that were active for longer time periods often shifted interactions, resulting in a sequential collection of their partners in time, rather than concurrence. For the seed dispersal mutualism in particular, sequential accumulation of partners may allow plant species more opportunities to disperse their seeds compared to concurrence. We suggest that for temporally and spatially heterogeneous landscapes, sequential accumulation of partners would serve to reduce competition and facilitate coexistence of species.},

Such processes may act differentially on subsets of the community characterised by specific traits. To gain a deeper insight into these mechanisms, we supplemented a common method of studying metacommunities with an analysis of individual species and their traits. River floodplains are challenging environments for metacommunity analysis due to their spatial heterogeneity, temporal stochasticity and configurations of the networks of waterbodies. An analysis of aquatic gastropods showed that both environmental and spatial factors had significant influence. Within the spatial variables tested, the configuration of the floodplain network upstream of a sampling site was particularly important. An analysis of individual species revealed that traits related to niche breadth and drift propensity were significant for structuring the assemblages: species with a broad niche width (i.e. generalist, or neutral species) and a high drift propensity were governed more by the spatial configuration, whereas environmental conditions mainly determined the distribution of specialists having traits that prevented drift. These results can be interpreted as a trade-off between habitat specialisation and colonisation ability: specialists succeed locally due to competitiveness and a strategy of reducing risks by preventing drift, whereas generalists may succeed regionally due to a strategy of spreading risks, by high levels of reproductive output, dispersal rates and adaptability. Our findings have implications for schemes to restore river floodplains that affect the aquatic network, with subsequent effects on community assembly and thus on biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Due to their ubiquity and highly efficient passive dispersal, benthic diatoms are an ideal group in which to explore the drivers of community spatial structure and the ultimate links between such patterns and species autoecology. However, studies addressing these issues have largely overlooked unicellular taxa to date. We examined the spatial order (i.e. nestedness) of a diatom meta-community of 122 lotic sites in the north-east Iberian Peninsula and the relationship between the contributions of individual species to nestedness and their niche breadths [measured using outlying mean index (OMI) analyses]. We observed a significantly nested pattern in the meta-community (T=14.05, NODF=22.57), although idiosyncratic species accounted for a substantial fraction (34\%) of the global species pool. Hydrological stability was identified as the main driver of nestedness. Highly stable, moderately stable and intermittent sites differed in nestedness and in alpha diversity, with intermittent sites being the most species poor and the least nested. We also observed a significant association between nestedness and niche attributes, with idiosyncratic species exhibiting wider distributions and larger niche breadths compared with nested species. Overall, our results indicate that diatom communities inhabiting hydrologically stable rivers present a higher level of order in community spatial pattern and a higher proportion of specialist taxa than communities in intermittent streams. Because recent hydroclimatic models predict an increase in stream intermittency in the Mediterranean region, our findings may help anticipate future diatom biodiversity patterns resulting from global change. We suggest that the current need to protect a diverse network of sites (as opposed to a few species-rich sites) will be even greater in the near future because local communities are not only probably to become taxonomically and functionally poorer but also less predictable, making it more difficult to implement efficient programmes for biodiversity conservation at the regional scale.},

In this context, stakeholders need indicators that both provide a synthetic view of the state of biodiversity and can be used as communication tools. Using river fishes as model, we developed community indicators that aim at integrating various components of biodiversity including interactions between species and ultimately the processes influencing ecosystem functions. We developed indices at the species level based on (i) the concept of specialization directly linked to the niche theory and (ii) the concept of originality measuring the overall degree of differences between a species and all other species in the same clade. Five major types of originality indices, based on phylogeny, habitat-linked and diet-linked morphology, life history traits, and ecological niche were analyzed. In a second step, we tested the relationship between all biodiversity indices and land use as a proxy of human pressures. Fish communities showed no significant temporal trend for most of these indices, but both originality indices based on diet-and habitat-linked morphology showed a significant increase through time. From a spatial point of view, all indices clearly singled out Corsica Island as having higher average originality and specialization. Finally, we observed that the originality index based on niche traits might be used as an informative biodiversity indicator because we showed it is sensitive to different land use classes along a landscape artificialization gradient. Moreover, its response remained unchanged over two other land use classifications at the global scale and also at the regional scale.},

These have been explained in terms of the relative abundance of species, using a null model that assigns links in proportion to abundance, but doubts have been raised as to whether this offers a complete explanation. In particular, host-parasite networks offer a variety of examples in which the reverse patterns are observed. We propose that the link between specificity and species richness may also be driven by the coevolution of hosts and parasites, as hosts allocate resources to optimize defense against parasites, and parasites to optimize attack on hosts. In this hypothesis, species interactions are a result of resource allocations. This novel concept, linking together many different arguments for network structures, is introduced through the adaptive dynamics of a simple ecological toy system of two hosts and two parasites. We analyze the toy model and its functionality, demonstrating that coevolution leads to specialization asymmetry in networks with closely related parasites or fast host mutation rates, but not in networks with more distantly related species. Having constructed the toy model and tested its applicability, our model can now be expanded to the full problem of a larger system.},

Here, we develop an island biogeography of biotic interactions, recognizing that, besides species richness, biodiversity also encompasses the multitude of interactions among species. By sampling interactions between plants and pollinators across the Canarian archipelago, we illustrate how the local richness, specialization and endemism of biotic interactions vary with island age and area. LocationCanary Islands (27.62 degrees N-29.42 degrees N and 13.33 degrees W-18.17 degrees W). MethodsOn five islands, covering the full age range of the archipelago, plant-pollinator interactions were catalogued and their strength estimated. Network parameters (e.g. interaction richness and specialization) and the number of single-island interactions (equivalent to single-island endemics) were estimated from interaction matrices and related to island area and age. ResultsPlant species richness, interaction richness and average degree of specialization of pollinator species showed hump-shaped relationships with island age. Pollinator richness varied with island area and plant richness. Plant specialization increased with island age, and the proportion of single-island interactions (pSII) exhibited a U-shaped relationship with age. Main conclusionsThe previously reported hump-shaped relationship between species richness and island age, both on the scale of islands and of habitats, was confirmed for plant species in local networks. Both plants and pollinators were more generalized on the youngest island, which may be due to a predominance of generalist colonists. Pollinator specialization peaked on mid-aged islands, whereas plants showed the highest specialization on old islands, potentially reflecting their different life histories. The U-shaped relationship between the proportion of single-island interactions and island age might be explained by (1) young islands having a high proportion of unique interactions, due to interactions between generalists, and (2) old islands having unique interactions due to an accumulation of unique pairwise interactions that have evolved through time. Thus, island age - which not only captures time per se, but also the geomorphological changes of islands - may act as a regional driver of local network structure, and so the contemporary networks we observed across the Canarian archipelago illustrate the development of a network through geological time.},

	abstract = {The migratory shorebirds of the East Atlantic flyway land in huge numbers during a migratory stopover or wintering on the French Atlantic coast. The Brouage bare mudflat (Marennes-Oleron Bay, NE Atlantic) is one of the major stopover sites in France. The particular structure and function of a food web affects the efficiency of carbon transfer. The structure and functioning of the Brouage food web is crucial for the conservation of species landing within this area because it provides sufficient food, which allows shorebirds to reach the north of Europe where they nest. The aim of this study was to describe and understand which food web characteristics support nutritional needs of birds. Two food-web models were constructed, based on in situ measurements that were made in February 2008 (the presence of birds) and July 2008 (absence of birds). To complete the models, allometric relationships and additional data from the literature were used. The missing flow values of the food web models were estimated by Monte Carlo Markov Chain - Linear Inverse Modelling. The flow solutions obtained were used to calculate the ecological network analysis indices, which estimate the emergent properties of the functioning of a food-web. The total activities of the Brouage ecosystem in February and July are significantly different. The specialisation of the trophic links within the ecosystem does not appear to differ between the two models. In spite of a large export of carbon from the primary producer and detritus in winter, the higher recycling leads to a similar retention of carbon for the two seasons. It can be concluded that in February, the higher activity of the ecosystem coupled with a higher cycling and a mean internal organization, ensure the sufficient feeding of the migratory shorebirds.},

	abstract = {Most terrestrial plants interact with diverse clades of mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi in their roots. Through belowground plant-fungal interactions, dominant plants can benefit by interacting with host-specific mutualistic fungi and proliferate in a community based on positive plant-mutualistic fungal feedback. On the other hand, subordinate plant species may persist in the community by sharing other sets (functional groups) of fungal symbionts with each other. Therefore, revealing how diverse clades of root-associated fungi are differentially hosted by dominant and subordinate plant species is essential for understanding plant community structure and dynamics. Based on 454-pyrosequencing, we determined the community composition of root-associated fungi on 36 co-occurring plant species in an oak-dominated forest in northern Japan and statistically evaluated the host preference phenotypes of diverse mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi. An analysis of 278 fungal taxa indicated that an ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete fungus in the genus Lactarius and a possibly endophytic ascomycete fungus in the order Helotiales significantly favored the dominant oak (Quercus) species. In contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were generally shared among subordinate plant species. Although fungi with host preferences contributed to the compartmentalization of belowground plant-fungal associations, diverse clades of ectomycorrhizal fungi and possible root endophytes were associated not only with the dominant Quercus but also with the remaining plant species. Our findings suggest that dominant-ectomycorrhizal and subordinate plant species can host different subsets of root-associated fungi, and diverse clades of generalist fungi can counterbalance the compartmentalization of plant-fungal associations. Such insights into the overall structure of belowground plant-fungal associations will help us understand the mechanisms that facilitate the coexistence of plant species in natural communities.},

Tolerance to environmental stress, resulting from wind abrasion and desiccation towards windswept ridges or reduced growing season due to prolonged snow cover towards snowbeds, is an important ecological mechanism in this gradient. The extent to which belowground fungal communities are structured by the same topographic gradient and the eventual mechanisms involved are less well known. In this study, we analysed variation in fungal diversity and community composition associated with roots of the ectomycorrhizal plant Bistorta vivipara along the ridge-to-snowbed gradient. We collected root samples from fifty B.vivipara plants in ten plots in an alpine area in central Norway. The fungal communities were analysed using 454 pyrosequencing analyses of tag-encoded ITS1 amplicons. A distinct gradient in the fungal community composition was found that coincided with variation from ridge to snowbeds. This gradient was paralleled by change in soil content of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. A large proportion (66\%) of the detected 801 nonsingleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were ascomycetes, while basidiomycetes dominated quantitatively (i.e. with respect to number of reads). Numerous fungal OTUs, many with taxonomic affinity to Sebacinales, Cortinarius and Meliniomyces, showed distinct affinities either to ridge or to snowbed plots, indicating habitat specialization. The compositional turnover of fungal communities along the gradient was not paralleled by a gradient in species richness.},

The use of a network approach allows one to take into account all interactions between a group of plants and its animal pollinators, and to reveal the structure of these connections. We analysed pollination interactions for urban habitat fragments located within the Warsaw city environment. We compared two similar, ruderal communities (phytosociological order Onopordetalia acanthii) located in distant parts of the city of Warsaw (Poland) that differed with the surrounding ecosystems. The aim of this study was to define the structures and properties of flower-visitor (visitation) and pollen transport networks (based on analysis of pollen loads carried by insects) and to assess the differences between the studied sites. Although the sites differed in insect relative abundance (Diptera dominated one study site, whereas Hymenoptera dominated the other), network size and structure were similar for both communities. In both cases, networks contained moderately specialized species (based on H (2)' index); however, networks were dominated by apparently ecologically generalized insect taxa as well as those represented by a single specimen. Networks based on pollen transport indicated greater generality of insect species (more links) than those based on our samples of visitation. The most highly linked plant species represented were either the most abundant (Fabaceae) or phenotypically generalized taxa (Daucus carota). We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions in such highly disturbed and isolated habitats are composed mostly of ecologically generalised species. Moreover, we stress the usefulness of pollen load analysis in the development and verification of visitation data.},

The network under investigation exhibited a nested pattern and low specialisation over most months. Monthly nestedness and specialisation in the network were negatively correlated, both being influenced by temporal variations in extrafloral nectar production of the plant community. The months of highest activity in the nectaries (August-November) were those when the level of generalisation in the network was at its highest. Although there were temporal variations in the properties of the network, the generalist core of the species remained the same over time. 4. The stable core enhances the coevolutionary importance of ant-plant interactions for the community. Thus, it can be concluded that the phenology of EFNs is one effective mechanism shaping the temporal variation in ant-plant interaction.},

The present study employed DNA bar coding to reveal the trophic associations of adult leaf-chewing chrysomelid beetles in a Bornean rainforest. Plant material ingested by the adults was retrieved from the bodies of the insects, and a portion of the chloroplast rbcL sequence was then amplified from this material. The plants were identified at the family level using an existing reference database of chloroplast DNA. Our DNA-based diet analysis of eleven chrysomelid species successfully identified their host plant families and indicated that five beetle species fed on more than two families within the angiosperms, and four species fed on several families of gymnosperms and/or ferns together with multiple angiosperm families. These findings suggest that generalist chrysomelid beetles associated with ecologically and taxonomically distant plants constitute a part of the plant-insect network of the Bornean rainforest.},

	abstract = {A fundamental goal of the study of ecology is to determine the drivers of habitat-forming vegetation, with much emphasis given to the relative importance to vegetation of "bottom-up" forces such as the role of nutrients and "top-down" forces such as the influence of herbivores and their predators. For coastal vegetation (e.g., kelp, seagrass, marsh, and mangroves) it has been well demonstrated that alterations to bottom-up forcing can cause major disturbances leading to loss of dominant vegetation. One such process is anthropogenic nutrient loading, which can lead to major changes in the abundance and species composition of primary producers, ultimately affecting important ecosystem services. In contrast, much less is known about the relative importance of apex predators on coastal vegetated ecosystems because most top predator populations have been depleted or lost completely. Here we provide evidence that an unusual four-level trophic cascade applies in one such system, whereby a top predator mitigates the bottom-up influences of nutrient loading. In a study of seagrass beds in an estuarine ecosystem exposed to extreme nutrient loading, we use a combination of a 50-y time series analysis, spatial comparisons, and mesocosm and field experiments to demonstrate that sea otters (Enhydra lutris) promote the growth and expansion of eelgrass (Zostera marina) through a trophic cascade, counteracting the negative effects of agriculturally induced nutrient loading. Our results add to a small but growing body of literature illustrating that significant interactions between bottom-up and top-down forces occur, in this case with consequences for the conservation of valued ecosystem services provided by seagrass.},

	abstract = {During recent human history, human activities such as overhunting and habitat destruction have severely impacted many large top predator populations around the world. Studies from a variety of ecosystems show that loss or diminishment of top predator populations can have serious consequences for population and community dynamics and ecosystem stability. However, there are relatively few studies of the roles of large top predators in coastal ecosystems, so that we do not yet completely understand what could happen to coastal areas if large top predators are extirpated or significantly reduced in number. This lack of knowledge is surprising given that coastal areas around the globe are highly valued and densely populated by humans, and thus coastal large top predator populations frequently come into conflict with coastal human populations. This paper reviews what is known about the ecological roles of large top predators in coastal systems and presents a synthesis of recent work from three coastal eastern US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites where long-term studies reveal what appear to be common themes relating to the roles of large top predators in coastal systems. We discuss three specific themes: (1) large top predators acting as mobile links between disparate habitats, (2) large top predators potentially affecting nutrient and biogeochemical dynamics through localized behaviors, and (3) individual specialization of large top predator behaviors. We also discuss how research within the LTER network has led to enhanced understanding of the ecological roles of coastal large top predators. Highlighting this work is intended to encourage further investigation of the roles of large top predators across diverse coastal aquatic habitats and to better inform researchers and ecosystem managers about the importance of large top predators for coastal ecosystem health and stability.},

This study assesses the influence of mutualistic interactions with pollinators on the diversity of plant communities with alternative means of reproduction besides animal pollination. In contrast to a recent more general model of plant-animal mutualisms, the results of our simulations suggest that interactions with pollinators do not generally promote plant diversity, irrespective of the structure of the interaction network. Despite a potential for increased plant species richness through the positive effect of pollinators on plant birth rates, species richness was mostly negatively affected by the presence of pollinators because existing abundance asymmetries were amplified by animal pollination. Our results imply that for plant communities with alternative means of reproduction, the loss of pollinators will usually not lead to decreased diversity. However, whereas the immediate effects of pollinator loss on plant community composition may be negligible, the long-term population genetic consequences are likely to be severe.},

	abstract = {In natural environments, distinct species interact with differing level of specialization, and thereby generate complex interaction networks. Recent studies have shown that certain antagonistic and mutualistic networks have a highly modular structure. This indicates that within an ecological network, densely connected semi-independent compartments occur and reflect different levels of the structural and functional system. Despite strong evidence for the existence of a modular structure in obligate and symbiotic networks involving ants and myrmecophytes, it is still uncertain whether these networks are modular. Here, we used the modularity index (M) to evaluate whether symbiotic ant-myrmecophyte networks exhibit a modular pattern of interactions. The analyses were based on a large data set of ant-myrmecophyte networks collected in mature and secondary forests of the Brazilian Central Amazon. Our results indicate that symbiotic ant-myrmecophyte networks are highly modular (M = 0.53 +/- A 0.13) regardless of forest type. Using other network descriptors, we found no difference in links per species (Links = 0.68 +/- A 0.15) and network connectance (C = 0.31 +/- A 0.17) among the different types of forest. Furthermore, the composition of ants and myrmecophytes did not differ among forest types (ANOSIM; P {\textgreater} 0.05), reinforcing the idea that this symbiotic interaction can be resistant to different local and landscape environmental factors. In summary, this study contributes to a better understanding of the way biodiversity is organized in obligate and symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms.},

By searching for seeds in mammal scats across four localities, we addressed how extensive seed dispersal was in relation to the fleshy-fruited plant community, and applied a network approach to identify the relative role of mammal species in the seed dispersal process. We also tested the response of mammalian dispersers to forest availability at increasing spatial scales. Five carnivores and three ungulates dispersed seeds of eight fleshy-fruited trees and shrubs. Mammalian seed dispersal did not mirror community-wide fruit availability, as abundant fruiting trees were scarce whereas thorny shrubs were over-represented among dispersed species. The dispersal network was dominated by bramble (Rubus ulmifolius/fruticosus), the remaining plants being rarer and showing more restricted disperser coteries. Fox (Vulpes vulpes), badger (Meles meles), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) dispersed mostly bramble, whereas martens (Martes sp.) dispersed mostly wild rose (Rosa sp.). Ungulates occasionally dispersed holly (Ilex aquifolium) and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). The empirical network reflected a skewed distribution of interactions and some functional complementarity (as judged from the low levels of connectance and nestedness), but also some degree of specialization. Mammals overused uncovered microsites for seed deposition, and increased their disperser activity in those landscape sectors devoid of forest. Combined with previous findings on avian seed dispersal, this study suggest a strong functional complementarity coming from the low overlap in the main plant types that mammals and birds disperse - thorny shrubs and trees, respectively - and the differential patterns of seed deposition, with mammals mostly dispersing into deforested areas, and birds into forest-rich landscapes.},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal by frugivores is the basis for regeneration of fleshy-fruited plants in forest ecosystems. Previous studies have reported a decrease in forest specialist frugivores due to logging and forest edges. Forest generalists appear less sensitive and may even increase at forest edges. Such changes in the abundance of frugivores may have consequences for consumer/resource ratios and competition in plant-frugivore networks. Optimal foraging theory predicts an increase in dietary specialization of animals at low consumer/resource ratios due to reduced competition. A decrease in forest specialists in logged forests should cause decreased consumer/resource ratios, increased dietary specialization and reduced redundancy, whereas an increased abundance of forest generalists at edges may compensate for a loss of specialists. In Europe's last old-growth lowland forest (Biaowiea, Eastern Poland), we recorded fruit removal by frugivores from fleshy-fruited plant species in the interior and at edges of logged and old-growth forests for 2 consecutive years. The abundance of forest generalists increased at forest edges, whereas specialists were unaffected. Conversely, logging resulted in a decrease in abundance of forest specialists but had no effect on the abundance of generalists. Accordingly, consumer/resource ratios increased from interior to edges and were reduced in the interior of logged forests compared with the interior of old-growth forests. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, a decrease in consumer/resource ratios coincided with increased dietary specialization and a loss of redundancy in the interior of logged forests. Despite low dietary specialization, redundancy was reduced at forest edges as forest generalists dominated plant-frugivore interactions. Synthesis. We show that a shift in frugivore assemblages at forest edges and increased dietary specialization of frugivores in the interior of logged forests involved a loss of redundancy compared with continuous old-growth forests.

	abstract = {Functional groups of species interact and coevolve in space and time, forming complex networks of interacting species. A long-term study of temporal variation of an antplant network is presented with the aims of: (1) depicting its structural changes over a 20-year period; (2) detailing temporal variation in network topology, as revealed by nestedness and modularity analysis and other parameters (i.e. connectance, niche overlap); and (3) identifying long-term turnover in taxonomic structure (i.e. switches in ant resource use or plant visitor assemblages according to taxa). Fieldwork was carried out at La Mancha, Mexico, and antplant interactions were observed between 1989 and 1991, between 1998 and 2000, and between May 2010 and 2011. Occurrences of ants on extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) were recorded. The resulting antplant networks were constructed from qualitative presenceabsence data determined by a speciesspecies matrix defined by the frequency of occurrence of each pairwise antplant interaction. Network variation across time was stable and a persistent nested structure may have contributed to the maintenance of resilient and species-rich communities. Modularity was lower than expected, especially in the most recent networks, indicating that the community exhibited high overlap among interacting species (e.g. few species were hubs in the more recent network, being partly responsible for the nested pattern). Structurally, the connections created among modules by super-generalists gave cohesion to subsets of species that otherwise would remain unconnected. This may have allowed an increasing cascade-effect of evolutionary events among modules. Mutualistic antplant interactions were structured 20 years ago mainly by the subdominant nectarivorous ant species Camponotus planatus and Crematogaster brevispinosa, which monopolized the best extrafloral nectar resources and out-competed other species with broader feeding habits. Through time, these ants, which are still present, lost their position as network hubs and diminished in their importance in structuring the network; simultaneously, plants gained in importance. The long-term network analysis reveals a decrease in attended plant species richness, a notable increase in plant species participation from 1990 to 2010 (sustained by less plant taxonomic similarity in the older 1990 network), an increase in the number of ant species and a diminishing dominance of super-generalist ants. The structure of the community has remained highly nested and connected with low modularity, suggesting overall a more participative, homogeneous, cohesive interaction network. Although previous studies have suggested that interactions between ants and EFN-bearing plants are susceptible to seasonality, abiotic factors and perturbation, this cohesive structure appears to be the key for biodiversity and community maintenance.},

While we typically observe only snapshots of the diverse assemblages and interactions under variable conditions, there is a desire to make inferences about prevalence and host-specificity patterns. We studied the interaction of ticks with non-volant small mammals in forests of Borneo. We inferred the probability of species interactions from individual-level data in a multi-level Bayesian model that incorporated environmental covariates and advanced estimates for rarely observed species through model averaging. We estimated the likelihood of observing particular interaction frequencies under field conditions and a scenario of exhaustive sampling and examined the consequences for inferring host specificity. We recorded a total of 13 different tick species belonging to the five genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus from a total of 37 different host species (Rodentia, Scandentia, Carnivora, Soricidae) on 237 out of 1,444 host individuals. Infestation probabilities revealed most variation across host species but less variation across tick species with three common rat and two tree shrew species being most heavily infested. Host species identity explained ca. 75 \% of the variation in infestation probability and another 8-10 \% was explained by local host abundance. Host traits and site-specific attributes had little explanatory power. Host specificity was estimated to be similarly low for all tick species, which were all likely to infest 34-37 host species if exhaustively sampled. By taking into consideration the hierarchical organization of individual interactions that may take place under variable conditions and that shape host-parasite networks, we can discern uncertainty and sampling bias from true interaction frequencies, whereas network attributes derived from observed values may lead to highly misleading results. Multi-level approaches may help to move this field towards inferential approaches for understanding mechanisms that shape the strength and dynamics in ecological networks.},

However, network theory has traditionally focused on the higher' trophic level where exploitation of network partners' (i.e. individual interactions in response to resource availability) have remained underappreciated. In this study we tested how clumping and host availability influenced mistletoehost interactions in a semi-arid woodland, central Australia. We used a hierarchical approach that evaluated individual interactions by modifying the traditional randomization technique to simulate clumping and host exploitation. Using published literature we then compared our results with mistletoes from other genera. We found that mistletoes clump on fewer trees than predicted, even though interaction strength was no different from random expectations, and we found no evidence that common trees were heavily infected as predicted by the host availability hypothesis. The rate of host exploitation (measured as the proportion of trees infected) in semi-arid Australia is similar to that for mistletoe genera in other parts of the world. We hypothesize that specific host trees act as a focal point for infection that facilitates the spread and overall population size of mistletoes. Overall our results indicate that resources, such as the number of trees in a mistletoe network, are less important than clumping of individual plants. We suggest that exploitation of available resources may play a similar role in other networks that extend beyond antagonistic relationships such as parasite or herbivore interactions.},

This well-documented evolutionary trend is known as "Williston's Law". Both loss and fusion of bones are developmental events that generate, at large evolutionary scales, a net reduction in the number of skull bones. We reassess this evolutionary trend by analyzing the patterns of skull organization captured in network models in which nodes represent bones and links represent suture joints. We also evaluate the compensatory process of anisomerism (bone specialization) suggested to occur as a result of this reduction by quantifying the heterogeneity and the ratio of unpaired bones in real skulls. Finally, we perform simulations to test the differential effect of bone losses in skull evolution. We show that the reduction in bone number during evolution is accompanied by a trend toward a more complex organization, rather than toward simplification. Our results indicate that the processes by which bones are lost or fused during development are central to explain the evolution of the morphology of the skull. Our simulations suggest that the evolutionary trend of increasing morphological complexity can be caused as a result of a structural constraint, the systematic loss of less connected bones during development.},

	abstract = {Many species are expanding their distribution towards higher latitudes and altitudes in response to climate change. These range shifts are expected to change fish community structure and alter food-web dynamics in subarctic lakes. However, the impacts of invading species on native fish and invertebrate prey communities remain understudied. The trophic ecology of invasive species determines the likelihood of direct resource competition with native taxa. In Northern Europe, perch (Perca fluviatilis), a trophic generalist, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), a benthic specialist, are expanding their distribution ranges northwards, colonising lakes inhabited by a native generalist, whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). We predicted that increased fish diversity and density would deplete the invertebrate community and increase resource competition between native and invasive species. To assess the degree of resource competition between native and invasive species, we compared (i) fish and invertebrate community structure; (ii) diet and stable carbon and nitrogen ratios of whitefish, ruffe and perch and (iii) growth, condition and relative population size of whitefish in two non-invaded lakes with two lakes containing one and two lakes containing both invasive species. Each lake was sampled on a single occasion between August and September. Benthic macroinvertebrate density and community structure were unaffected by increased consumer diversity, while top-down control of pelagic zooplankton density and size was evident in lakes with increased fish diversity. Differences in diet and stable isotope ratios were evident between all whitefish populations, although these were not directly related to the presence of invasive species. Specialised adaptations of invasive species may confer a competitive advantage in invaded lakes; ruffe dominated the profundal niche, while perch displayed an ontogenetic shift to piscivory, reducing niche overlap with native whitefish. Growth rate and population density of whitefish were largely independent of fish community structure and were governed by local variations in lake productivity. However, there was a sign of lowered condition of whitefish in invaded systems. Shallow and more productive lakes with higher food availability supported populations of native and invasive species. Our findings indicate that trophic specialisations of invasive species play a key role in determining their impacts on the systems they invade. This study focussed on early stages of invasion, and the outcome of species interactions may change following the establishment of new species. In addition, these impacts will not be uniform across the invaded landscape as lake-specific variations in morphometry and resource availability will alter the competitive balance between native and invasive species.},

This broad generalization, often based on pollination web data, has been challenged by the fact that some floral visitors recorded in pollination webs are ineffective pollinators. To contribute to this debate, and to obtain a contrast between visitors and pollinators, we studied insect and bird visitors to virgin flowers of Hypoestes aristata in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon. We observed the flowers and their visitors for 2-h periods and measured the seed production as a metric of reproductive success. We determined the effects of individual visitors using 2 statistical models, single-visit data that were gathered for more frequent visitor species, and frequency data. This approach enabled us to determine the positive as well as neutral or negative impact of visitors on H. aristata's reproductive success. We found that (i) this plant is not generalized but rather specialized; although we recorded 15 morphotaxa of visitors, only 3 large bee species seemed to be important pollinators; (ii) the carpenter bee Xylocopa cf. inconstans was both the most frequent and the most effective pollinator; (iii) the honey bee Apis mellifera acted as a nectar thief with apparent negative effects on the plant reproduction; and (iv) the close relationship between H. aristata and carpenter bees was in agreement with the large-bee pollination syndrome of this plant. Our results highlight the need for studies detecting the roles of individual visitors. We showed that such an approach is necessary to evaluate the pollination syndrome hypothesis and create relevant evolutionary and ecological hypotheses.},

We built models of interaction probabilities among species to assess if host traits and abundance and spatial overlap of species predict the quantitative epiphytehost network. Species abundance, species spatial overlap and host size largely predicted pairwise interactions and several network metrics. Wood density and bark texture of hosts also contributed to explain network structure. Epiphytes were more common on large hosts, on abundant woody species, with denser wood and/or rougher bark. The network had a low level of specialization, although several interactions were more frequent than expected by the models. We did not detect a phylogenetic signal on the network structure.

We compared intrapopulation variability in delta C-13 and delta N-15 for an estuarine omnivore, Spotted Seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), to test assumptions and assess the utility of SI analysis for delineation of the connectivity of this species with other species in estuarine food webs. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values showed patterns of enrichment in fish caught from coastal to offshore sites and as a function of fish size. Results for delta C-13 were consistent in liver and muscle tissue, but liver delta N-15 showed a negative bias when compared with muscle that increased with absolute delta N-15 value. Natural variability in both isotopes was 5-10 times higher than that observed in laboratory populations, indicating that environmentally driven intrapopulation variability is detectable particularly after individual bias is removed through sample pooling. These results corroborate the utility of SI analysis for examination of the position of Spotted Seatrout in an estuarine food web. On the basis of these results, we conclude that interpretation of SI data in fishes should account for measurable and ecologically relevant intrapopulation variability for each species and system on a case by case basis.},

	abstract = {Nestedness is an intriguing feature of ecological networks, where those species found in species-depauperate communities are subsets of those found in communities with greater species richness. For bipartite interaction networks, a "community" of species may be thought of as all those pollinating a particular plant, or infecting a particular host, for example. While there is much clear evidence for nestedness in mutualistic webs, host-parasite webs have proven more contentious. There have been a number of suggested causes for nestedness, including an association between the abundance of individuals and the resulting number of species interactions, and the matching of phenotypic traits between species. Questions remain as to the relative importance of these driving factors, especially as host-parasite and mutualistic webs contain completely different interaction types. We propose a model motivated by both of the above factors, considering a trade-off in resources that a species faces in optimizing its transmission or defense. We construct a multi-species model in which both hosts and parasites have limited resources with which to attack or defend themselves from each other. We analyze the evolution of the manner in which they use these resources using adaptive dynamics, to arrive at a final species interaction matrix, which we then test for nestedness. A general model with m hosts and n microparasite species is described here, but results are given for m = n = 5, chosen to be a large enough system for patterns to be identified, but not so large that computational time becomes prohibitive. Our results demonstrate that this co-evolution leads to an unusual amount of nestedness when the trade-offs in transmission for parasites are concave, and an unusual amount of anti-nestedness when they are convex. This enables us to predict the circumstances under which we would expect to observe nestedness in real networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We investigated the feeding strategies of two species, Leptochiton boucheti and Nierstraszella lineata, recovered on sunken wood sampled in the western Pacific, close to the Vanuatu Islands. The two species display distinctly different associations with bacterial partners. Leptochiton boucheti harbours Mollicutes in regions of its gut epithelium and has no abundant bacterium associated with its gill. Nierstraszella lineata displays no dense gut-associated bacteria, but harbours bacterial filaments attached to its gill epithelium, related to the Deltaproteobacteria symbionts found in gills of the wood-eating limpet Pectinodonta sp. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures and an absence of cellulolytic activity give evidence against a direct wood-feeding diet; both species are secondary consumers within the wood food web. We suggest that the distinct associations with bacterial partners are linked to niche specialisations of the two species. Nierstraszella lineata is in a taxonomic family restricted to sunken wood and is possibly adapted to more anoxic conditions thanks to its gill-associated bacteria. Leptochiton boucheti is phylogenetically more proximate to an ancestral form not specialised on wood and may itself be more of a generalist; this observation is congruent with its association with Mollicutes, a bacterial clade comprising gut-associated bacteria occurring in several metazoan phyla.},

	abstract = {The so-called negritos adapt not just to a tropical forest environment but also to an environment characterized by perturbations and fluctuations. As with other hunter-gatherers in the region and, indeed, throughout the world, they use both social and ecological methods to enhance their chances of survival in this changing environment: socially, they have developed networks of trading and marriage partners; ecologically, they maintain patches of key resources that are available for future harvesting. As evidenced in the case of the Batek (Orang Asli), patterns of forest structure and composition are sometimes direct outcomes of intentional resource concentration and enrichment strategies. While little of the above is controversial anthropologically, what has drawn some debate is the nature of the relationship with partner societies. Conventional wisdom posits relations of inequality between foragers and "others": foragers and farmers are often construed as hierarchical dyads where foragers supply products or labor to farmers in exchange for agricultural harvests and other trade goods. This kind of adaptation appears to be one of divergent specialization. However, there are cases, such as in the relationship between Batek and Semaq Beri, where both societies follow a roughly similar mode of adaptation, and specialization has not materialized. In sum, while not denying that hierarchy and inequality exist, I suggest that they have to be contextualized within a larger strand of relationships that includes both hierarchy and egality. Further, such relationships are part of the general portfolio of risk reduction strategies, following which access to widely scattered environmental resources, and passage from one location to another, is enhanced not by competing with and displacing neighbors but by maintaining a flexible regime of friendly exchange partners.},

This study compared the trophic niche differentiations of Neogobius melanostomus and Ponticola kessleri in the upper Danube River using stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15), gut content analyses and morphometric analyses of the digestive tract. Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strategy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogammarus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. delta N-15-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by similar to 1.5aEuro degrees, indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanostomus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increasing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (similar to 92\% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous invasions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems.},

We investigated the importance of fruit abundance, fruiting plant species richness and canopy cover within habitat fragments for the structure and robustness of plant-frugivore networks in a mosaic forest landscape of South Africa. In total, 53 avian species were involved in fruit removal of 31 fleshy-fruiting plant species. Species specialisation was always higher for plants than for frugivores. Both species and network-level specialisation increased with increasing fruit abundance and decreased with increasing fruiting plant species richness and canopy cover within fragments. Interaction diversity was unaffected by fruit abundance and canopy cover, but increased slightly with increasing fruiting plant species richness. These findings suggest that especially the availability of resources is an important determinant of the structure of plant-frugivore networks in a fragmented forest landscape.},

We found that after correcting for evolutionary history, tree species identity influenced belowground arthropod communities through plant functional traits.

During the adaptation of a bacterial population to a new ecological niche, and particularly for intracellular bacteria, selective pressures are shifted and ecological niches reduced, resulting in a lower rate of genetic connectivity. HGT and positive selection are therefore two important evolutionary forces in microbial pathogens that drive adaptation to new hosts. In this study, we use genomic distance analyses, phylogenomic networks, tree topology comparisons, and Bayesian inference methods to investigate to what extent HGT has occurred during the evolution of the genus Rickettsia, the effect of the use of different genomic regions in estimating reticulate evolution and HGT events, and the link of these to host range. We show that ecological specialization restricts recombination occurrence in Rickettsia, but other evolutionary processes and genome architecture are also important for the occurrence of HGT. We found that recombination, genomic rearrangements, and genome conservation all show evidence of network-like evolution at whole-genome scale. We show that reticulation occurred mainly, but not only, during the early Rickettsia radiation, and that core proteome genes of every major functional category have experienced reticulated evolution and possibly HGT. Overall, the evolution of Rickettsia bacteria has been tree-like, with evidence of HGT and reticulated evolution for around 10-25\% of the core Rickettsia genome. We present evidence of extensive recombination/incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) during the radiation of the genus, probably linked with the emergence of intracellularity in a wide range of hosts.},

	abstract = {Humans can unintentionally induce both positive and negative effects on wildlife presence and abundance, with organisms living in or associated with agricultural areas being good examples. Our study focused on a 1500 ha area (75 sampled 100 m x 50 m plots) at the driest edge of the endemic Iberian mole Talpa occidentalis distribution range, where the species is listed as "Vulnerable". Here, poplar cultivations dominate wasteland and other irrigated and non-irrigated crops. The poplar irrigation system was traditionally based on a network of straight ridges, although it is rapidly being replaced with a sophisticated procedure which permits water to spread with ridges no longer being needed. In these habitats, ridges are relevant for moles because they provide dry shelters for nests. In this paper we explore (a) mole local habitat preferences and (b) the impact of changes in poplar irrigation systems on mole abundance. Iberian mole abundance positively related to earthworm biomass and numbers; however, multivariate analyses highlighted the effect of herbaceous cover (positive relationship), rocks cover and soil hardness (negative relationship), and habitat type (poplar being the preferred one). Furthermore, mole abundance was substantially higher in poplar groves where ridges were still present than where they were not. We conclude that Iberian moles in semi-arid environments are favoured by poplar plantations but, at the same time, they are highly vulnerable to recent changes in traditional agriculture practices. Therefore, this study shows how agricultural habitats can benefit some species of conservation concern, especially some temperate species at the edge of their range or in extreme ecological conditions. Changes in agricultural practices that negatively affect the suitability of such habitats can compromise these species's conservation, as we found for the Iberian mole.

To fulfill this objective, Auxis rochei larvae were sampled in the Balearic Sea (NW Mediterranean). A principal components analysis distinguished 2 types of surface water masses from a total of 40 stations that showed particular hydrobiological differences-resident Atlantic water (hereafter MW) and fresh Atlantic water (hereafter AW) masses-which showed significant differences in temperature, salinity and mesozooplankton biomass. Size-fractioned zooplankton analysis revealed greater biomass in the {\textgreater}250 mu m fraction at AW stations, while the N and C composition of this fraction was higher at MW stations. Bullet tuna from MW were significantly larger and heavier and, consequently, had a higher Fulton's condition factor and higher daily growth rates. The delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of the zooplankton size fractions did not show significant differences between MW and AW. However, significantly higher delta C-13 found in MW larvae suggests differences in the origin of food supplies. Moreover, the significantly higher N-15 values in bullet larvae collected in MW indicate a greater trophic specialization, possibly due to differences in the zoo-planktonic food web of the water masses. Auxis rochei larvae showed a higher trophic level resulting from its higher N-15 isotopic enrichment compared with the small zooplankton size fraction. The stable isotope analysis demonstrates its potential in distinguishing variable trophic pathways in early life stages of fish inhabiting open sea marine ecosystems.},

While increasing number of network data are available and are used in comparative studies, data quality and uncertainty have received little attention. Moreover, key individual-level information such as the proportion of individuals not involved in interactions and underlying processes driving interactions are ignored by aggregated data analysis. We suggest an individual-level hierarchical interaction model as a more flexible approach to considering uncertainty, sampling effort and conditions under which interactions take place and from which network attributes can be derived. We performed a simulation exercise to compare inference under different sample sizes and from aggregated data matrices to those from our individual-level model. Formalizing the process of network formation in an individual-level model made clear that per-species interaction frequencies are not independent of sample size and population pools and also ignore important information given by the proportion of non-interacting individuals. Hierarchical linear models are a possible solution to infer community-level attributes of network formation and allow various kinds of comprehensive model extensions to capture variation of per-individual interactions in space and time that shape upper level organization. Individual-level hierarchical models provide the link between individual behaviour and interactions under variable environmental conditions and can be summarized into networks in a conceptually neat way. Such models may not only help to account for various sources of variation but also conceptualize aspects overlooked in aggregated data. In particular, the quantification of per-individual interactions under different sampling scenarios emphasizes that per-species interaction frequencies at the species level are not necessarily a surrogate of species abundance in natural systems under investigation.},

To bridge this gap, we quantify genotypic interaction networks among individuals of a single specialized parasitoid species and its obligate to cyclically parthenogenetic aphid host along a climatic gradient. As a case study for the kinds of questions genotype food webs could be used to answer, we show that genetically similar parasitoids became more likely to attack genetically similar hosts in warmer sites (i.e. there was network-wide congruence between the within-species shared allelic distance of the parasitoid and that of its host). Narrowing of host-genotype-niche breadth by parasitoids could reduce resilience of the network to changes in host genetic structure or invasion by novel host genotypes and inhibit biological control. Thus, our approach can be easily used to detect changes to sub-species-level food webs, which may have important ecological and evolutionary implications, such as promoting host-race specialization or the accelerated loss of functional diversity following extinctions of closely related genotypes.},

Synchrony may be an important variable in multispecies systems, but its nature and implications have not been explicitly examined. Because the number of locally coexisting species (richness) affects the population variability of community members, we manipulated richness under different regimes of environmental fluctuation (EF). We predicted that the temporal synchrony of populations in a species should decline with increasing richness of the metacommunity they live in. Additionally, we predicted that specialist species that are sensitive to a specific environmental factor would show higher synchronization when EF increases. We thus created experimental communities with varied richness, EF, and species specialization to examine the synchronizing effects of these factors on three aquatic invertebrate species. We created four levels of richness and three levels of EF by manipulating the salinity of the culture media. Monocultures exhibited higher population synchrony than metacommunities of 2-4 species. Furthermore, we found that species responded differently to EF treatments: high EF enhanced population synchrony for the specialist and intermediate species, but not for the generalist species. Our findings emphasize that the magnitude of EF and species richness both contribute to determine population synchrony, and importantly, our results suggest that biotic diversity may actually stabilize metacommunities by disrupting synchrony.},

However, interspecific niche segregation and individual specialisation may limit the potential for generalistic feeding behaviour. 2. We studied summer habitat use, stomach contents and stable isotopic compositions of the generalist feeder Arctic charr coexisting with its common resource competitor brown trout in five subarctic lakes in northern Norway to reveal population-level and individual-level niche plasticity. 3. Charr and trout showed partial niche segregation in all five lakes. Charr used all habitat types and a wide variety of invertebrate prey including zooplankton, whereas trout fed mainly on insects in the littoral zone. Hence, charr showed a higher potential to promote habitat and food-web coupling compared to littoral-dwelling trout. 4. The level of niche segregation between charr and trout and between pelagic-caught and littoral-caught charr depended on the prevailing patterns of interspecific and intraspecific resource competition. The two fish species had partially overlapping trophic niches in one lake where charr numerically dominated the fish community, whereas the most segregated niches occurred in lakes where trout were more abundant. 5. In general, pelagic-caught charr had substantially narrower dietary and isotopic niches and relied less on littoral carbon sources compared to littoral-caught conspecifics that included generalist as well as specialised benthivorous and planktivorous individuals. Despite the partially specialised planktivorous niche and thus reduced potential of pelagic-dwelling charr to promote benthicpelagic coupling, the isotopic compositions of both charr subpopulations suggested a significant reliance on both littoral and pelagic carbon sources in all five study lakes. 6. Our study demonstrates that both interspecific niche segregation between and individual trophic specialisation within generalist fish species can constrain food-web coupling and alter energy mobilisation to top consumers in subarctic lakes. Nevertheless, pelagic and littoral habitats and food-web compartments may still be highly integrated due to the potentially plastic foraging behaviour of top consumers.},

By conducting controlled laboratory experiments using model consumer populations (Daphnia sp., Crustacea) with controlled diets, we investigated the effect of individual- and population-level specialisation and generalism on consumer d13C mean and variance values. While our experimental data follow general expectations, we extend current qualitative models to quantitative predictions of the dependence of isotopic variance on dietary correlation time, a measure for the typical time over which a consumer changes its diet. This quantitative approach allows us to pinpoint possible procedural pitfalls and critical sources of measurement uncertainty. Our results show that the stable isotope approach represents a powerful method for estimating trophic niche widths, especially when taking the quantitative concept of dietary correlation time into account.},

Here, we focus on two key traits: body size and ecological specialization. We present theoretical expectations and empirical evidence on how climate change affects these traits within communities. We then explore how these traits predispose species to shift or expand their distribution ranges, and associated changes on community size structure, food web organization and dynamics. We identify three major broad changes: (i) Shift in the distribution of body sizes towards smaller sizes, (ii) dominance of generalized interactions and the loss of specialized interactions, and (iii) changes in the balance of strong and weak interaction strengths in the short term. We finally identify two major uncertainties: (i) whether large-bodied species tend to preferentially shift their ranges more than small-bodied ones, and (ii) how interaction strengths will change in the long term and in the case of newly interacting species.},

We quantified the degree to which the increase in the number of species interactions with area differed from a null model based on sampling, where numbers of individuals increase with area. Although plant-pollinator interactions were expected to increase more steeply with area than species richness as a result of sampling, the observed rate of increase was considerably lower than expected. Two mechanisms could lead to this pattern: a higher proportion of specialist species in larger glades or generalist pollinators becoming more selective in their diets in larger glades. We found support for the former hypothesis, and those changes in species composition were strong enough to outweigh behavioral changes in the opposite direction; generalist pollinators were more selective in smaller glades.

Emergent optimal foraging theory-based models for individual variation go beyond the population level and predict how its individuals would respond to disturbances that produce changes in resource availability. 2. Evaluating variations in resource use patterns at the intrapopulation level in wild populations under changing environmental conditions would allow to further advance in the research on foraging ecology and evolution by gaining a better idea of the underlying mechanisms explaining trophic diversity. 3. In this study, we use a large spatio-temporal scale data set (western continental Europe, 19682006) on the diet of Bonellis Eagle Aquila fasciata breeding pairs to analyse the predator trophic responses at the intrapopulation level to a prey population crash. In particular, we borrow metrics from studies on network structure and intrapopulation variation to understand how an emerging infectious disease [the rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD)] that caused the density of the eagles primary prey (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) to dramatically drop across Europe impacted on resource use patterns of this endangered raptor. 4. Following the major RHD outbreak, substantial changes in Bonellis Eagles diet diversity and organisation patterns at the intrapopulation level took place. Dietary variation among breeding pairs was larger after than before the outbreak. Before RHD, there were no clusters of pairs with similar diets, but significant clustering emerged after RHD. Moreover, diets at the pair level presented a nested pattern before RHD, but not after. 5. Here, we reveal how intrapopulation patterns of resource use can quantitatively and qualitatively vary, given drastic changes in resource availability. 6. For the first time, we show that a pathogen of a prey species can indirectly impact the intrapopulation patterns of resource use of an endangered predator.},

	abstract = {Aim We studied, for the first time, the effect of insularity on plantseed disperser networks at both the community and species level. We focused on the Mediterranean shrubland, comparing different biogeographical scenarios (insular and continental) that share the same basic species composition. Location The study was conducted within one mainland (southern Spain) and four island localities: two in the Canary Islands (oceanic origin) and two in the Balearic Islands (continental origin). Methods We built qualitative (presence/absence of interaction) and quantitative seed dispersal networks (number of consumed fruits) and used different descriptor parameters, such as connectance, nestedness, interaction asymmetry and various interaction diversity indices that describe their topology. To assemble the interaction networks, we used data on the presence of different species of fruits in systematically collected droppings of the different seed dispersers; seeds in droppings were identified by means of a binocular lens whereas a microscope was used to identify pericarp tissue remains. Results Island networks were smaller and less complex (a lower number of observed links than expected for their size) than the mainland network. As expected, connectance was higher within islands than on the mainland. By contrast, nestedness was consistently high at all sites, although relative nestedness (which accounts for network size) was lower within islands, whether continental or oceanic. At both community and species level (especially for animals) interactions tended to be more specialized and symmetric within the islands. Main conclusions The lower species number and greater specialization in insular seed dispersal systems appears to lead to the prevalence of more symmetric interactions than those found on the mainland. This indicates that insular mutualistic interactions and interacting species are more vulnerable than mainland ones to disturbances, as previous work has suggested that asymmetrical interactions facilitate the maintenance of biodiversity and act as a resilience mechanism against species extinction.},

	abstract = {This essay juxtaposes modularity and emergence in the consideration of biological systems at various scalar levels of spatio-temporal organisation. It is noted that reductionism, specialisation and modularity are basic prerequisites for understanding life. It is realised that increased progress of scientific biology in elucidating mechanisms at the level of modular components supports the accusation that the more it advances in materialistic description of details, the more it diverts from understanding the innate properties of life. It is clear that modularity, by taking the whole as the sum of its parts, is insufficient for understanding living systems. At the same time, however, there is emergence, as advocated by Robert Laughlin. Emergence after the integration of modules leads to completely new properties of individual organisms as unique unitary entities, and also of systems of organisms with synergistic and antagonistic interactions of the integrated species. The discussion is predominantly based on examples from plant biology. At hierarchically higher scalar levels emergent biological systems are networks integrating species, biotopes, ecosystems and the entire biosphere of Earth, also named Gaia by James Lovelock, in a natural scientific respect. While investigating modules remains essential, biology as a nature science needs to merge and integrate such information to be able to unfold emergence. Through efforts towards visualising and understanding emergent diversity and complexity, the research discipline of biology will provide invaluable contributions to understanding life, and thus refute the accusation that it diverts from embracing the innate properties of life.},

	abstract = {Long-term or lifetime specificity in plantpollinator relationships is likely a consequence of natural selection to not only enhance the probability of cross-pollination but also to improve pollinator efficiency. Dependency on one or few pollinators involves risk whereas multiple species may reduce the probability of extinction via unreliable pollinator service. We analyzed specificity in terms of factors that may ameliorate risk such as long-term pollinator population stability, abundance and the duration of flowering. Bee population stability indices from seven continuous years of census data, combined with pollinator and flowering phenology data for 37 plant species in Panama, revealed pollinator specificity was not related to pollinator population stability. No relationship existed between the length of a flowering season and population stability of associated pollinators. Further data from 30 years of euglossine monitoring also revealed no relationship between bee abundance and specificity. However, a strong relationship was revealed between length of flowering period and specificity. A longer flowering season was associated with lower specificity and shorter flowering was associated with higher specificity, which is as expected if specificity is the outcome of a sampling problem but not as expected if specificity is accompanied by risk reduction. Plantpollinator specificity involving euglossine bees is evidently not related to bee population stability, abundance, or length of flowering period, in a manner that we predicted would be associated with reducing the risk of extinction. Variation in population stabilities of euglossines may be insufficient to be a factor in the evolution of plantpollinator specificity. In the tropics, specificity may be more associated with plant longevity, selection for efficiency or effectiveness, or flowering duration as a sampling phenomenon, than with reducing dependence on unreliable pollinators.},

	abstract = {Volunteer-based standardized monitoring of birds has been widely implemented in Europe and North America. In France, a breeding bird survey is running since 1989 and offers keen birdwatchers to count spring birds annually during 5 min exactly on 10 fix points within a randomly selected square. The first goal of such breeding bird surveys is to measure temporal trends in order to detect possible species declines. Combining annual indices of species sharing ecological affinities or a protected/red list status further provides biodiversity indicators for policy makers. Because the sampling effort is similar among sites, and because the initial selection of monitored sites is random, the temporal trends can be considered representative of national trends, and spatial comparisons of the obtained metrics are possible. Species abundance, community richness but also community specialization and average trophic level can be estimated for each site and each year and further related to the wide range of habitat and landscape characteristics and to agricultural or forestry practices. The large number of sites allows overcoming the opposition between adaptive and passive monitoring, making such schemes fitted to adaptive monitoring. This provides opportunities to determine which type of management or practices favour biodiversity. The comparison of population fate or community dynamics across a wide range of climates and temperatures, e.g. from southern to northern Europe, revealed how European birds are already affected by climate change. Bird communities are shifting northwards, but at a slower rate than temperatures, while bird populations have larger growth rates away from their hot thermal limit. Finally, such large-scale long-term monitoring data on a complete taxonomic group (Ayes) is original and offers the opportunity to compare different measures of biological diversity, such as taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity. Such a citizen science scheme is an efficient scientific tool (numerous papers published in international peer-reviewed journals) which is furthermore highly cost-effective, with a reduced permanent staff in a state insitution coordonating the network and analysing the data, while a similar survey conducted by state staff only would cost more than one million euros annually. The future development of bio-economic dynamic models for providing scenarios of sustainable farming and logging to maintain biodiversity will further highlight the necessity of such volunteer monitoring for policy makers and decision planning. Scientific and logistic partnerships could be proposed to help developing such a monitoring scheme in China. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Community-level studies have shown that plantpollinator interactions are much more generalized than previously expected. Consequently, many authors have questioned the significance of phenotypic complementarity between plants and pollinators and abundance effects in pollination interactions. Here, we compare the behaviour of three sunbird species feeding on the nectar of five plant species in afromontane vegetation. We studied the feeding behaviour with and without consideration of plant abundance (i.e. diet selectivity and diet composition, respectively). The aims of the study were to estimate: (1) how relative resource abundance influences flower selectivity; (2) the degree of phenotypic matching; and (3) whether different plant resource assessment methods give different answers to this question. The results showed that, although sunbirds frequently feed on both morphologically adapted and nonadapted plants, food selectivity data are consistent with the hypothesis of phenotypic complementarity. Moreover, we found that the type of plant abundance measurement can change conclusions in some cases, as individual plants differ in their growth habits and nectar production. This effect was most obvious for the assessment of selectivity of the northern double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris reichenowi) and for Hypoestes aristata, a plant producing inflorescences composed of a large number of small flowers possessing small amounts of nectar per flower (a high abundance of flowers, but a low abundance of nectar relative to the remaining plant community).

Depending upon the differences in host quality and transmission asymmetries, as well as the balance between intra- and interspecific transmission, the evolution of specialist or generalist strategies is predicted. Using a trypanosome parasite of bumblebees, we ask how host quality and transmission networks relate to parasite population structure across host species, and thus the potential for the evolution of specialist strains adapted to different host species. Host species differed in quality, with parasite growth varying across host species. Highly asymmetric transmission networks, together with differences in host quality, likely explain local population structure of the parasite across host species. However, parasite population structure across years was highly dynamic, with parasite populations varying significantly from one year to the next within individual species at a given site. This suggests that, while host quality and transmission may provide the opportunity for short-term host specialization by the parasite, repeated bottlenecking of the parasite, in combination with its own reproductive biology, overrides these smaller scale effects, resulting in the evolution of a generalist parasite.},

Orchid mycorrhizal symbioses are particularly interesting as they are viewed as more beneficial for plants than for fungi, a situation expected to result in an asymmetry of biological constraint. This study addressed the architecture and phylogenetic constraint in these associations in tropical context. We identified a bipartite network including 73 orchid species and 95 taxonomic units of mycorrhizal fungi across the natural habitats of Reunion Island. Unlike some recent evidence for nestedness in mycorrhizal symbioses, we found a highly modular architecture that largely reflected an ecological barrier between epiphytic and terrestrial subnetworks. By testing for phylogenetic signal, the overall signal was stronger for both partners in the epiphytic subnetwork. Moreover, in the subnetwork of epiphytic angraecoid orchids, the signal in orchid phylogeny was stronger than the signal in fungal phylogeny. Epiphytic associations are therefore more conservative and may co-evolve more than terrestrial ones. We suggest that such tighter phylogenetic specialization may have been driven by stressful life conditions in the epiphytic niches. In addition to paralleling recent insights into mycorrhizal networks, this study furthermore provides support for epiphytism as a major factor affecting ecological assemblage and evolutionary constraint in tropical mycorrhizal symbioses.},

	abstract = {Forest fragmentation and local disturbance are prevailing threats to tropical forest ecosystems and affect frugivore communities and animal seed dispersal in different ways. However, very little is known about the effects of anthropogenic forest edges and of local disturbance on the structure and robustness of plantfrugivore networks. We carried out focal tree observations to record the frugivore species feeding on eight canopy tree species in the forest interior and at forestfarmland edges in a little and a highly disturbed part of a Kenyan rain forest. For each frugivore species, we recorded its body mass and its forest dependence. We examined how forest edge and local disturbance affected the abundance, the richness and the composition of the frugivore community and tested whether forest edge and local disturbance affected plant frugivore networks. Abundance and species richness of frugivores were higher at edges than in the forest interior. Forest visitors and small-bodied frugivores increased, while forest specialists decreased in abundance at forest edges. The changes in frugivore community composition resulted in plantfrugivore networks that were more connected, more nested and more robust against species extinctions at forestfarmland edges than in the forest interior. Network specialization was lower at forest edges than in the forest interior because at the edges plant specialization on frugivores was very low in small-fruited species. In contrast, small-fruited plants were more specialized than large-fruited plants in the forest interior. Our findings suggest that forest-visiting birds may stabilize seed-dispersal services for small-fruited plant species at rain forest margins, while seed-dispersal services for large-fruited plant species may be disrupted at forest edges due to the decrease of large-bodied frugviores. To assess the ultimate consequences of bird movements from farmland to forest edges for ecosystem functioning, future studies are required to investigate the seed-dispersal qualities provided by forest-visiting bird species in the tropics.},

Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that mycorrhizal network size and root colonization were greater when Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. was grown with siblings compared to strangers. Soil fungal abundance was positively correlated with group leaf nitrogen, and increased root colonization was associated with a reduced number of pathogen-induced root lesions, indicating greater benefit to plants grown with siblings.

Our meta-analysis reveals that the majority of coral species and Symbiodinium types are specialists, but failed to detect any one-to-one obligate relationships. Symbiont specificity is correlated with a host's transmission mode, with horizontally transmitting corals being more likely to interact with generalist symbionts.

However, ecological processes underpinning their evolutionary diversification in association with other trophic groups are still unclear. Specialisation and interdependencies among chalcid wasps that reproduce on Ficus presents an opportunity to investigate the ecology of a multi-trophic system that includes parasitoids. Here we estimate the host-plant species specificity of a parasitoid fig wasp genus that attacks the galls of non-pollinating pteromalid and pollinating agaonid fig wasps. We discuss the interactions between parasitoids and the Ficus species present in a forest patch of Uganda in context with populations in Southern Africa. Haplotype networks are inferred to examine intraspecific mitochondrial DNA divergences and phylogenetic approaches used to infer putative species relationships. Taxonomic appraisal and putative species delimitation by molecular and morphological techniques are compared. Results demonstrate that a parasitoid fig wasp population is able to reproduce on at least four Ficus species present in a patch. This suggests that parasitoid fig wasps have relatively broad host-Ficus species ranges compared to fig wasps that oviposit internally. Parasitoid fig wasps did not recruit on all available host plants present in the forest census area and suggests an important ecological consequence in mitigating fitness trade-offs between pollinator and Ficus reproduction. The extent to which parasitoid fig wasps exert influence on the pollination mutualism must consider the fitness consequences imposed by the ability to interact with phenotypes of multiple Ficus and fig wasps species, but not equally across space and time.},

In successfully occupying this habitat, it evolved a suite of specific biological, ecological and physiological adaptations to the environmental conditions in the cold and highly seasonal Antarctic waters. Specialization for the pelagic environment evolved over millions of years enabled life under unusual environmental constraints and colonization of the pelagic realm of the Antarctic continental shelf. A sudden change of environmental conditions driven by the current rapid climate change could negatively affect this weak equilibrium, with a catastrophic cascade effecting higher trophic levels.

	abstract = {Despite the considerable work carried out to assess the structure of weighted and unweighted mutualistic networks, little is known about how different ways to measure the weight of interactions can influence network parameters used to describe such structures. The use of an appropriate 'link weight' is especially important if we want to move toward a more functional perspective in ecological network studies. Here, we evaluated how the use of five different link weights, starting with the simplest one - the number of visits - and including progressively information on total census time, number of flowers observed, number of flowers visited and total flower abundance of each species in a plant community, influences widely used descriptors of network structure. We analyzed different network-level properties: weighted nestedness, flower-visitor generality, plant generality, complementary specialization H-2', interaction evenness and interaction diversity, as well as species-level parameters: specialization index d' and strength. We built two quantitative flower-visitation networks from two different communities sampled during two consecutive years, in which we also measured independently flower abundance of each plant species. Results showed that the type of link weight used can significantly alter network structure. A clear trend toward more specialized interactions (decreased flower-visitor generality, increased H-2' and d'), higher heterogeneity in the frequency of interactions (lower evenness and diversity of interactions) and higher weighted nestedness was found as interaction weight gained in complexity. However, standardizing only for total censusing time had only weak effects on network parameters. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the most appropriate link weight for each ecological network study, emphasizing that comparisons across networks that use different weights might lead to flawed results and thus to ecological misinterpretations of network structures.},

The number of correctly predicted interactions was highest when thresholds were set so that the insect's proboscis was not shorter than the nectar-holder depth minus 1-1.6 mm, and not wider than the nectar-holder width minus 0.5 mm. In comparison with models based solely on plant abundance effects, the model incorporating optimized size thresholds better predicted the distribution of the trait differences between plants and insects.

This relationship was not an artefact of simple isolation-by-distance, as genetic distance was not correlated with the Euclidean distance between geographical centroids of the adjacent populations. Our results suggest that gap size affects movement behaviour even at remarkably local spatial scales, producing direct consequences on the genetic structure of fragmented populations. This finding shows that conserving genetic continuity for specialist species within fragmented habitat requires maintenance or restoration of preserve networks in which habitat gaps do not exceed a species-specific threshold distance.},

Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species ("niche forbidden links"), neutral processes create "neutral forbidden links" due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.},

	abstract = {Background: The organization of networks of interacting species, such as plants and animals engaged in mutualisms, strongly influences the ecology and evolution of partner communities. Habitat fragmentation is a globally pervasive form of spatial heterogeneity that could profoundly impact the structure of mutualist networks. This is particularly true for biodiversity-rich tropical ecosystems, where the majority of plant species depend on mutualisms with animals and it is thought that changes in the structure of mutualist networks could lead to cascades of extinctions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We evaluated effects of fragmentation on mutualistic networks by calculating metrics of network structure for ant-plant networks in continuous Amazonian forests with those in forest fragments. We hypothesized that networks in fragments would have fewer species and higher connectance, but equal nestedness and resilience compared to forest networks. Only one of the nine metrics we compared differed between continuous forest and forest fragments, indicating that networks were resistant to the biotic and abiotic changes that accompany fragmentation. This is partially the result of the loss of only specialist species with one connection that were lost in forest fragments. Conclusions/Significance: We found that the networks of ant-plant mutualists in twenty-five year old fragments are similar to those in continuous forest, suggesting these interactions are resistant to the detrimental changes associated with habitat fragmentation, at least in landscapes that are a mosaic of fragments, regenerating forests, and pastures. However, ant-plant mutualistic networks may have several properties that may promote their persistence in fragmented landscapes. Proactive identification of key mutualist partners may be necessary to focus conservation efforts on the interactions that insure the integrity of network structure and the ecosystems services networks provide.},

	volume = {153},

	doi = {10.1007/s10336-012-0861-z},
	abstract = {Worldwide, populations of a diverse array of bamboo-specialist birds must respond to the life cycles of typical woody bamboos, which include a long vegetative phase, a short period in sexual reproduction (seeding), and a short period dead. While some bamboo species flower continuously in time, but scattered in space, over different parts of their distribution, others exhibit a single, synchronized mass-seeding event, followed by death over hundreds of square kilometers. Thus, bamboo-specialist birds experience extreme variability in their habitat and food sources, and may pass from a period of overabundant habitat and food resources to a period of extreme resource scarcity. At a community level, bamboo species are out of phase with each other. Masting events of several bamboo species may coincide one cycle, but not the next. The resulting long-term dynamics of bamboo cycles at a community scale will result in a temporal and geographic mosaic of resource availability over very long periods of time, where the initial conditions that any bird experienced may occur only sporadically over centuries and very large regions. We aim to propose a theoretical framework for understanding the population ecology of bamboo-specialist birds and discuss implications for their conservation. Three main diet and life-history strategies of bamboo-specialist birds can be identified based on their natural history. First, insectivorous bamboo specialists that inhabit woody bamboos may be relatively sedentary during the long vegetative growth phase, but they must experience population declines, switch to alternative habitat, or travel widely during bamboo die-off events. They benefit from long-term habitat stability but must face short-term reductions in habitat that do not affect all generations of birds. Second, bamboo seed specialists must rely on an ephemeral source of food available only after large intervals of time at most locations. Since bamboo cycles are typically much longer than the lives of individual birds, there is no chance for seed-specialist birds to learn when and where bamboo seeds will be available in the future. Thus, although bamboo seed availability is ecologically predictable (i.e., seeds are always available after the same length of time at a given place), seed availability is unpredictable to individual birds. During their lifetime, most individual bamboo seed-specialists must face a lack of their preferred food supply, at which time they must wander to survive. And third, mixed strategists usually feed on bamboo shoots, leaves, and insects, but consume bamboo seeds when available. Their life history combines elements of both previous categories: they can benefit from long-term habitat stability like insectivores, and take advantage of masting events like seed specialists. Niche width (degree of specialization) in conjugation with the long-term dynamics of bamboo cycles should determine the degree of nomadism and amplitude of bamboo-specialist population cycles. Nomadism appears to be distributed along a continuum from the temporarily nomad insectivores and mixed strategists to the local and regional nomadic seed specialists. A protected area cannot shelter healthy populations of the most specialized bamboo-seed specialists because they track temporally and spatially unpredictable resources over large temporal and spatial scales. Overall, to effectively protect this ecological system, it is crucial to conserve a network of natural areas capable of providing bamboo in different phases and at different times and places, as well as subsidiary food resources that will allow birds to move away from bamboo patches as they become unsuitable to new, suitable patches.},

The Matching Alleles (MA) and Gene For Gene (GFG) models have been extensively studied as the canonical examples of specific and non-specific interaction. The generality of these models has recently been challenged by uncovering real-world host-parasite systems exhibiting specificity patterns that fit neither MA nor GFG, and by the discovery of symbiotic bacteria protecting insect hosts against parasites. In the present paper we address both challenges, simulating a large number of non-canonical models of host-parasite interactions that explicitly incorporate symbiont-based host resistance. To assess the genetic specialisation in these hybrid models, we develop a quantitative index of specificity applicable to any coevolutionary model based on a fitness matrix. We find qualitative and quantitative effects of host-parasite and symbiont-parasite specificities on genotype frequency dynamics, allele survival, and mean host and parasite fitnesses.},

	abstract = {Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, displays phosphorylation-dependent localization in the seminiferous epithelium of adult rat testes. FAK is an integrated component of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) involved in regulating Sertoli cell adhesion via its effects on the occludin-zonula occludens-1 complex. Herein, we report that p-FAK-Tyr(407) and p-FAK-Tyr(397) display restricted spatiotemporal and almost mutually exclusive localization in the epithelium, affecting BTB dynamics antagonistically, with the former promoting and the latter disrupting the Sertoli cell tight junction-permeability barrier function. Using primary cultured Sertoli cells as an in vitro model that mimics the BTB in vivo both functionally and ultrastructurally, effects of FAK phosphorylation on BTB function were studied by expressing nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutants, with tyrosine replaced by phenylalanine (F) and glutamate (E), respectively. Compared with WT FAK, Y407E and Y397F mutations each promoted barrier function, and the promoting effect of the Y407E mutant was abolished in the Y397E-Y407E double mutant, demonstrating antagonism between Tyr(407) and Tyr(397). Furthermore, Y407E mutation induced the recruitment of actin-related protein 3 to the Sertoli cell-cell interface, where it became more tightly associated with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, promoting actin-related protein 2/3 complex activity. Conversely, Y407F mutation reduced the rate of actin polymerization at the Sertoli cell BTB. In summary, FAK-Tyr(407) phosphorylation promotes BTB integrity by strengthening the actin filament-based cytoskeleton. FAK serves as a bifunctional molecular "switch" to direct the cyclical disassembly and reassembly of the BTB during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis, depending on its phosphorylation status, to facilitate the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes across the BTB.},

To date, most studies on mutualistic networks assert that interaction properties such as species' degree (k) and strength (s) are strongly influenced by species abundances. We evaluated how species' degree and strength change as a function of temporal variation not only in species abundance, but also in species persistence (i.e., phenology length). In a two-year study, we collected community-wide data on seed dispersal by birds and examined the seasonal dynamics of the above-mentioned interaction properties. Our analyses revealed that species abundance is an important predictor for plant strength within a given sub-network. However, our analyses also reveal that species' degree can often be best explained by the length of fruiting phenology (for plants degree) or by the number of fruiting species (for dispersers degree), which are factors that can be decoupled from the relative abundance of the species participating in the network. Moreover, our results suggest that generalist dispersers (when total study period is considered) act as temporal generalists, with degree constrained by the number of plant species displaying fruits in each span. Along with species identity, our findings underscore the need for a temporal perspective, given that seasonality is an inherent property of many mutualistic networks.},

	abstract = {Background: The positive relationship between habitat area and species number is considered a fundamental rule in ecology. This relationship predicts that the link number of species interactions increases with habitat area, and structure is related to habitat area. Biological invasions can affect species interactions and area relationships. However, how these relationships change at different spatial scales has remained unexplored. We analysed understory plant-pollinator networks in seven temperate forest sites at 20 spatial scales (radius 120-2020 m) to clarify scale-associated relationships between forest area and plant-pollinator networks. Results: The pooled data described interactions between 18 plant (including an exotic) and 89 pollinator (including an exotic) species. The total number of species and the number of interaction links between plant and pollinator species were negatively correlated with forest area, with the highest correlation coefficient at radii of 1520 and 1620 m, respectively. These results are not concordant with the pattern predicted by species-area relationships. However, when associations with exotic species were excluded, the total number of species and the number of interaction links were positively correlated with forest area (the highest correlation coefficient at a radius of 820 m). The network structure, i.e., connectance and nestedness, was also related to forest area (the highest correlation coefficients at radii of 720-820 m), when associations with exotics were excluded. In the study area, the exotic plant species Alliaria petiolata, which has invaded relatively small forest patches surrounded by agricultural fields, may have supported more native pollinator species than initially expected. Therefore, this invasive plant may have altered the original relationships between forest area and plant-pollinator networks. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate scale-dependent effects of forest area on the size and structure of plant-pollinator networks. We also suggest that a single exotic plant species can impact plant-pollinator networks, even in temperate continental habitats.},

We examine how pollination niche breadth affects plant responses to pollinator abundance, comparing early-flowering (specialized) and late-flowering (generalized) cohorts of T. parryi and early T. parryi to T. dasyphyllum, a pollination generalist. Co-pollinators disrupt the link between B. balteatus visitation and pollination rate for both clovers. Only for early-flowering T. parryi do visitation, pollination, and seed set increase with density of B. balteatus. Bumble bee density also alters timing of seed germination in T. parryi, with seeds from plants receiving augmented B. balteatus germinating sooner than seeds of open-pollinated counterparts. Benefits saturate at intermediate bumble bee densities. Despite strong effects of B. balteatus density on individual plant fitness components, population models suggest little impact of B. balteatus density on lambda in T. parryi or T. dasyphyllum. Findings show that functional redundancy in a pollinator guild mediates host-plant responses to partner density.

One of the most critical assumptions of network analysis is that the observed interaction patterns constitute an adequate sample of the set of interactions present in plant-animal communities. In spite of its importance, few studies have evaluated this assumption, and in consequence, there is no consensus on the sensitivity of network metrics to sampling methodological shortcomings. In this study we examined how variation in sampling completeness influences the estimation of six network metrics frequently used in the literature (connectance, nestedness, modularity, robustness to species loss, path length, and centralization). We analyzed data of 186 flowering plants and 336 pollinator species in 10 networks from a forest-fragmented system in central Chile. Using species-based accumulation curves, we estimated the deviation of network metrics in undersampled communities with respect to exhaustively sampled communities and the effect of network size and sampling evenness on network metrics. Our results indicate that: (1) most metrics were affected by sampling completeness but differed in their sensitivity to sampling effort; (2) nestedness, modularity, and robustness to species loss were less influenced by insufficient sampling than connectance, path length, and centralization; (3) robustness was mildly influenced by sampling evenness. These results caution studies that summarize information from databases with high, or unknown, heterogeneity in sampling effort per species and should stimulate researchers to report sampling intensity to standardize its effects in the search for broad patterns in plant-pollinator networks.},

However, little information is available on the dietary breadth of frugivorous birds in a community and the avian attributes influencing it. In this study, we evaluated and compared the dietary breadth of 23 frugivorous birds (including both seed dispersers and seed predators) in relation to their feeding strategies (depending on which the birds were categorized into four types as gulpers, grinders, crushers and peckers) and other avian attributes. In particular, we hypothesized that feeding types with long fruit-handling time (i.e. crushers and peckers) have a narrow dietary breadth. Our analysis was based on the data obtained through long-term volunteer monitoring in the lowland forests of Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. We evaluated the dietary breadth of the birds while controlling for differences in sampling efforts and seasonal variation in the available fruit assemblages among the birds. Our analysis revealed that there was a large variation in dietary breadth among the birds, even after controlling for differences in sampling efforts and seasonal variation in the available fruit assemblages. Feeding strategies of the birds defined their dietary breadth to some degree, but we found little support for the hypothesis that fruit handling determines dietary breadth. We also observed a large variation in dietary breadth among the gulpers, which act mainly as seed dispersers for plants, and this variation could not be explained fully by other avian attributes. Our results showed that variation in the dietary breadth of frugivorous birds is partly determined by their feeding strategies and suggested that other unknown factors may play a role in determining dietary breadth variation and in structuring fruitbird interaction networks.},

	abstract = {1. Describing and explaining the structure of species interaction networks is of paramount importance for community ecology. Yet much has to be learned about the mechanisms responsible for major patterns, such as nestedness and modularity in different kinds of systems, of which large and diverse networks are a still underrepresented and scarcely studied fraction. 2. We assembled information on fishes and their parasites living in a large floodplain of key ecological importance for freshwater ecosystems in the Parana River basin in South America. The resulting fishparasite network containing 72 and 324 species of fishes and parasites, respectively, was analysed to investigate the patterns of nestedness and modularity as related to fish and parasite features. 3. Nestedness was found in the entire network and among endoparasites, multiple-host life cycle parasites and native hosts, but not in networks of ectoparasites, single-host life cycle parasites and non-native fishes. All networks were significantly modular. Taxonomy was the major hosts attribute influencing both nestedness and modularity: more closely related host species tended to be associated with more nested parasite compositions and had greater chance of belonging to the same network module. Nevertheless, host abundance had a positive relationship with nestedness when only native host species pairs of the same network module were considered for analysis. 4. These results highlight the importance of evolutionary history of hosts in linking patterns of nestedness and formation of modules in the network. They also show that functional attributes of parasites (i.e. parasitism mode and life cycle) and origin of host populations (i.e. natives versus non-natives) are crucial to define the relative contribution of these two network properties and their dependence on other ecological factors (e.g. host abundance), with potential implications for community dynamics and stability.},

	abstract = {The healthy microbiota show remarkable variability within and among individuals. In addition to external exposures, ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this variation. It is thus of interest to assess what relationships might exist among microbes and determine their underlying reasons. The initial Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort, comprising 239 individuals and 18 different microbial habitats, provides an unprecedented resource to detect, catalog, and analyze such relationships. Here, we applied an ensemble method based on multiple similarity measures in combination with generalized boosted linear models (GBLMs) to taxonomic marker (16S rRNA gene) profiles of this cohort, resulting in a global network of 3,005 significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between 197 clades occurring throughout the human microbiome. This network revealed strong niche specialization, with most microbial associations occurring within body sites and a number of accompanying inter-body site relationships. Microbial communities within the oropharynx grouped into three distinct habitats, which themselves showed no direct influence on the composition of the gut microbiota. Conversely, niches such as the vagina demonstrated little to no decomposition into region-specific interactions. Diverse mechanisms underlay individual interactions, with some such as the co-exclusion of Porphyromonaceae family members and Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque supported by known biochemical dependencies. These differences varied among broad phylogenetic groups as well, with the Bacilli and Fusobacteria, for example, both enriched for exclusion of taxa from other clades. Comparing phylogenetic versus functional similarities among bacteria, we show that dominant commensal taxa (such as Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides in the gut) often compete, while potential pathogens (e. g. Treponema and Prevotella in the dental plaque) are more likely to co-occur in complementary niches. This approach thus serves to open new opportunities for future targeted mechanistic studies of the microbial ecology of the human microbiome.},

While maintaining their nested structure, nestedness increased with mean monthly precipitation and, particularly, with monthly temperature. Moreover, some species changed their role in network structure, shifting from peripheral to core species within the nested network. We could summarize that abiotic factors affect plant species in the vegetation (e.g., phenology), meaning presence/absence of food sources, consequently an increase/decrease of associations with ants, and finally, these variations to fluctuations in nestedness. While biotic factors are certainly important, greater attention needs to be given to abiotic factors as underlying determinants of the structures of ecological networks.},

Although it has been shown that species with common habitat requirements share particular traits, it remains relatively unexplored to what extent this may lead to the repeated evolution of almost identical phenotypes (phenocopies) and how this correlates with traits subjected to sexual selection. Exploring divergence patterns of ecological and sexual relevant traits within spiders seem promising to enhance our understanding of the relative role of natural and sexual selection. Here, we conduct a detailed morphological analysis on a large set of genital and non-genital traits (morphometrics, colour pattern) within a radiation of the wolf spider genus Hogna Simon, 1885 on Galapagos and interpret these data, taking into account their known phylogenetic relationship. Our results show that recurrent environmental gradients have led to the parallel evolution of almost identical phenotypes, which not only proves that natural selection has driven morphological divergence, but also suggests that a similar genetic or developmental basis most likely underlies this divergence. Among-species variation in genital traits in contrast rather reflects the phylogenetic relationships on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal. The combination of these data indicate that speciation in this system is driven by the combined effect of ecological mechanisms and allopatric divergence in sexual traits.

The differences in the trophic roles of the coexisting species have been exclusively studied from their gut contents, while no data are available on the comparative digestive capacity. In the present paper, we make a comparative study of the activity of several digestive enzymes, namely proteases (at different pH), amylase, lipase, trypsin and chymotrypsin, in two species of stoneflies, Perla bipunctata and Dinocras cephalotes, which cohabit in the same stream. The study of digestive enzyme activity together with the analysis of gut contents can contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of these aquatic insects and their role in freshwater food webs. Thus, our results show that the two studied predator species inhabiting in the same stream present specializations on their feeding behaviors, facilitating their coexistence, and also differences in their capacity of use the resources. One of the main findings of this study is that D. cephalotes is able to assimilate a wider trophic resource spectrum and this could be one of the reasons why this species has a wider global distribution in all its geographical range.

	abstract = {1. We studied the theoretical prediction that a loss of plant species richness has a strong impact on community interactions among all trophic levels and tested whether decreased plant species diversity results in a less complex structure and reduced interactions in ecological networks. 2. Using plant species-specific biomass and arthropod abundance data from experimental grassland plots (Jena Experiment), we constructed multitrophic functional group interaction webs to compare communities based on 4 and 16 plant species. 427 insect and spider species were classified into 13 functional groups. These functional groups represent the nodes of ecological networks. Direct and indirect interactions among them were assessed using partial Mantel tests. Interaction web complexity was quantified using three measures of network structure: connectance, interaction diversity and interaction strength. 3. Compared with high plant diversity plots, interaction webs based on low plant diversity plots showed reduced complexity in terms of total connectance, interaction diversity and mean interaction strength. Plant diversity effects obviously cascade up the food web and modify interactions across all trophic levels. The strongest effects occurred in interactions between adjacent trophic levels (i.e. predominantly trophic interactions), while significant interactions among plant and carnivore functional groups, as well as horizontal interactions (i.e. interactions between functional groups of the same trophic level), showed rather inconsistent responses and were generally rarer. 4. Reduced interaction diversity has the potential to decrease and destabilize ecosystem processes. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of basal producer species leads to more simple structured, less and more loosely connected species assemblages, which in turn are very likely to decrease ecosystem functioning, community robustness and tolerance to disturbance. Our results suggest that the functioning of the entire ecological community is critically linked to the diversity of its component plants species.},

Because sea otters are now extinct from much of this region and have not fully recolonized their former range (e.g. Haida Gwaii and most of northern BC) these data represent an important first step towards better understanding sea otter foraging ecology in BC. The isotopic data suggest a diet composed primarily of benthic invertebrates, with a very low reliance on epibenthic fish. There is very low isotopic and thus inter-individual dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters during the late Holocene. Furthermore, zooarchaeological abundance data suggest that otters represented a widespread and significant focus of aboriginal hunting practices on the northern BC coast during the mid- to late-Holocene. The consistent reliance on a small number of low-trophic level prey and limited dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters may reflect top-down impacts on otter populations by aboriginal peoples. As part of our assessment of sea otter diet, we review trophic discrimination factors (Delta C-13 and Delta N-15) for bone collagen from published literature and find marked variability, with mean values of +3.7 +/- 1.6 for Delta C-13 (n = 21) and +3.6 +/- 1.3 for Delta N-15 (n = 15).

Traditional null model analyses showed support for negative co-occurrence patterns, web specialisation and strong links between species pairs.

Using insect-plant interactions as a model, we focus on important developments in four critical areas: genetic architecture, behavior, interaction complexity, and macroevolution. We find that theory based on simple genetic trade-offs in host use is being replaced by more subtle and complex pictures of genetic architecture, and multitrophic interactions have risen as a necessary framework for understanding specialization. A wealth of phylogenetic data has made possible a more detailed consideration of the macroevolutionary dimension of specialization, revealing (among other things) bidirectionality in transitions between generalist and specialist lineages. Technological advances, including genomic sequencing and analytical techniques at the community level, raise the possibility that the next decade will see research on specialization spanning multiple levels of biological organization in non-model organisms, from genes to populations to networks of interactions in natural communities.

Individuals within species are often assumed to have an equivalent ecological role despite increasing evidence that among-individual variation in resource use within populations is common. Such intraspecific variation in resource use can be a result of ontogenetic-based diet shifts, differences in individual feeding behavior within age groups (i.e., individual specialization), and temporal variation in resource pools. We examined trophic interactions in schoolmaster, Lutjanus apodus (Walbaum, 1972), over multiple seasons and across size classes in a Bahamian wetland system. Using combined stable isotope and stomach content analyses, we found that, as with many other fishes, subadults fed at higher trophic levels than juveniles, likely because of a shift from feeding predominantly on lower trophic-level prey taxa (e.g., crabs) to higher trophic-level prey taxa (e.g., teleosts). Despite a considerable overlap in stable isotope values between subadults and juveniles, stable isotope and stomach content data suggest a switch from feeding predominantly within mangrove prop roots as juveniles to foraging increasingly in adjacent seagrass beds as subadults. Niche width and degree of individual dietary specialization varied among years, suggesting important levels of temporal variation. In sum, individual snapper do not use resources homogeneously, and we outline some of the factors, including predation risk, increase piscivory, and temporal differences in resource use, that underlie this variation.},

Previous studies suggest that pollination network structure remains nested while network composition is highly dynamic. However, little is known about temporal variation in the structure and function of plant-pollinator networks, especially in species-rich communities where the strength of pollinator competition is predicted to be high. Here we quantify temporal variation of pollination networks over four consecutive years in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains biodiversity hotspot in China. We found that ranked positions and idiosyncratic temperatures of both plants and pollinators were more conservative between consecutive years than in non-consecutive years. Although network compositions exhibited high turnover, generalized core groups - decomposed by a k-core algorithm - were much more stable than peripheral groups. Given the high rate of turnover observed, we suggest that identical plants and pollinators that persist for at least two successive years sustain pollination services at the community level. Our data do not support theoretical predictions of a high proportion of specialized links within species-rich communities. Plants were relatively specialized, exhibiting less variability in pollinator composition at pollinator functional group level than at the species level. Both specialized and generalized plants experienced narrow variation in functional pollinator groups. The dynamic nature of pollination networks in the alpine meadow demonstrates the potential for networks to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in species composition in a high biodiversity area.},

We used spiders, the most diversified group of terrestrial predators, to investigate whether stenophagy (1) promoted diversification; (2) was phylogenetically conserved and evolutionarily derived state; and (3) was determined either by geographical distribution and foraging guild. We used published data on the prey of almost 600 species. Six categories of stenophagy were found: myrmecophagy, araneophagy, lepidopterophagy, termitophagy, dipterophagy, and crustaceophagy. We found that the species diversity of euryphagous genera and families was similar to stenophagous genera and families. At the family level, stenophagy evolved repeatedly and independently. Within families, the basal condition was oligophagy or euryphagy. Most types of stenophagy were clearly derived: myrmecophagy in Zodariidae; lepidopterophagy in Araneidae; dipterophagy in Theridiidae. In contrast, araneophagy was confined to basal and intermediate lineages, suggesting its ancestral condition. The diet breadth of species from the tropics and subtropics was less diverse than species from the temperate zone. Diet breadth was lower in cursorial spiders compared to web-building species. Thus, the evolution of stenophagy in spiders appears to be complex and governed by phylogeny as well as by ecological determinants.},

However, it is unclear which mechanisms give rise to these network properties. Phenology seems important, because it shapes the topology of mutualistic networks, but its effects on the dynamics of mutualistic networks have scarcely been studied. Here, we study these effects with a general dynamical model of mutualistic and competitive interactions where the interaction strength depends on the temporal overlap between species resulting from their phenologies. We find a negative complexitystability relationship, where phenologies maximising mutualistic interactions and minimising intraguild competitive interactions generate speciose, nested and poorly connected networks with moderate asymmetry and low resilience. Moreover, lengthening the season increases diversity and resilience. This highlights the fragility of real mutualistic communities with short seasons (e.g. Arctic environments) to drastic environmental changes.},

This study used molecular techniques to detect haemoparasites in marsh warblers and in other passerines that feed in reed beds, at 4 sites in Portugal. The host-specificity of the parasite lineages was analysed and compared with other cases described in the literature to assess whether apparent host specificity changes according to the studied system. Nine lineages of Haemoproteus and 15 of Plasmodium were found, of which only 10 Plasmodium were proven to have local transmission. Each lineage was confined to a distinct set of host species. The distribution of parasites in the host species was non-nested, meaning that specialist lineages did not always share hosts with generalists. The most prevalent lineages were those with a wider host range, indicating that the ability to infect more hosts will enhance a parasite's prevalence in its entire host range. We also found that in our areas, a specialist parasite (H. MW1) appears to have a more generalist character than described in the literature, suggesting that a parasite's apparent specialization can depend on the type of host species sampled.},

Coastal habitats contain prey from the terrestrial biome, the marine biome and prey confined to the coastal region. Such habitats have therefore been suggested to better support predator populations compared to habitats without coastal access. We used stable isotope data on a small generalist predator, the arctic fox, to infer dietary strategies between adult and juvenile individuals with and without coastal access on Iceland. Our results suggest that foxes in coastal habitats exhibited a broader isotope niche breadth compared to foxes in inland habitats. This broader niche was related to a greater diversity of individual strategies rather than to a uniform increase in individual niche breadth or by individuals retaining their specialization but increasing their niche differentiation. Juveniles in coastal habitats exhibited a narrower isotope niche breadth compared to both adults and juveniles in inland habitats, and juveniles in inland habitats inhabited a lower proportion of their total isotope niche compared to adults and juveniles from coastal habitats. Juveniles in both habitats exhibited lower intra-individual variation compared to adults. Based on these results, we suggest that foxes in both habitats were highly selective with respect to the resources they used to feed offspring, but that foxes in coastal habitats preferentially utilized marine resources for this purpose. We stress that coastal habitats should be regarded as high priority areas for conservation of generalist predators as they appear to offer a wide variety of dietary options that allow for greater flexibility in dietary strategies.},

However, earlier studies have concluded that the specific mechanisms of plant-pollinator interactions are destabilizing and should lead to a loss of diversity. Here we present a mechanistic model of plant and pollinator population dynamics with the ability to represent a broad spectrum of interaction structures. Using this model, we examined the influence of pollinators on the stability of a plant community and the relationship between pollinator specialization and stability. In accordance with earlier work, our results show that plant-pollinator interactions may severely destabilize plant coexistence, regardless of the degree of pollinator specialization. However, if plant niche differentiation, a classical stabilizing mechanism, is sufficiently strong to overcome the minority disadvantage with respect to pollination, interactions with pollinators may even increase the stability of a plant community. In addition to plant niche differentiation, the relationship between specialization and stability depends on a number of parameters that affect pollinator growth rates. Our results highlight the complex effects of this particular type of mutualism on community stability and call for further investigations of the mechanisms of diversity maintenance in plant-pollinator systems.},

	abstract = {Species belonging to the same ecological guild can coexist only if there are differences in their responses to limiting resources. Thus, competitor introductions may modify the niches of the resident competitors, but empirical studies are rare. The extent of niche modification might further depend on the species' trophic specialisation along the specialists-to-generalists axis. In this study, we performed a semi-natural experiment by introducing a trophically specialised piscivorous fish (pikeperch) to the resident predator guild of a trophic generalist (perch) and a trophic specialist (pike) in a temperate freshwater lake. Individual diet data were used to calculate total niche hypervolume and inter- and intraspecific dietary niche overlap to evaluate strength of competitive interactions before and after pikeperch introduction. In both pike and perch, there was a moderate niche compression in response to pikeperch stocking. Furthermore, whereas perch diet hypervolume did not overlap at all with that of pikeperch, the intersection of niche space between the two trophic specialists was highly asymmetrical in favour of pike due to its less specialised diet composition in comparison with pikeperch. The intraspecific dietary niche overlap between perch size classes reflected an enhanced partitioning, whereas that of pike size classes was found almost unchanged in response to pikeperch stocking. These empirical results corroborate that competitive interactions and the degree of specialisation may strongly shape the success of introductions of top-predators in freshwater ecosystems. The most specialised species may persist only if the competitors belong rather to the generalists along the specialisation continuum. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

We investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects the evolution of specialization and associated community structure. Environmental productivity influences victim investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of specialization through its regulating effect on enemy investment in infectivity. We also investigate the epidemiological consequences of environmental variability and show that enemy population density is maximized for intermediate lengths of productive seasons, which corresponds to situations where enemies can evolve higher infectivity than victims can evolve defence. We discuss our results in the light of empirical studies, and further highlight ways in which our model applies to a range of natural systems.},

Publications are an accepted measure of research output, and network models can describe the collaborative nature of publication. In particular, ecological networks can serve as analogies for publication and technology adoption. We constructed network models of adoption of bioinformatics programming languages and health IT (HIT) from the literature. We selected seven programming languages and four types of HIT. We performed PubMed searches to identify publications since 2001. We calculated summary statistics and analyzed spatiotemporal relationships. Then, we assessed ecological models of specialization, cooperativity, competition, evolution, biodiversity, and stability associated with publications. Adoption of HIT has been variable, while scripting languages have experienced rapid adoption. Hospital systems had the largest HIT research corpus, while Perl had the largest language corpus. Scripting languages represented the largest connected network components. The relationship between edges and nodes was linear, though Bioconductor had more edges than expected and Perl had fewer. Spatiotemporal relationships were weak. Most languages shared a bioinformatics specialization and appeared mutualistic or competitive. HIT specializations varied. Specialization was highest for Bioconductor and radiology systems. Specialization and cooperativity were positively correlated among languages but negatively correlated among HIT. Rates of language evolution were similar. Biodiversity among languages grew in the first half of the decade and stabilized, while diversity among HIT was variable but flat. Compared with publications in 2001, correlation with publications one year later was positive while correlation after ten years was weak and negative. Adoption of new technologies can be unpredictable. Spatiotemporal relationships facilitate adoption but are not sufficient. As with ecosystems, dense, mutualistic, specialized co-habitation is associated with faster growth. There are rapidly changing trends in external technological and macroeconomic influences. We propose that a better understanding of how technologies are adopted can facilitate their development.},

Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in vibrissae from 53 seals, we examined the trophic ecology of crabeater seals from the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001, 2002 and 2007. We observed a wide variability in individual seal mean delta C-13 values, which ranged from -19.8 parts per thousand to -24.9 parts per thousand, whereas mean delta N-15 value varied from 5.4 parts per thousand to 7.9 parts per thousand. We identified a positive significant effect of seal mass on delta C-13 values, as well as a significant seasonal effect (higher delta C-13 values in austral winter), which likely resulted from changes in the composition of the community of primary producers. delta N-15 values for crabeater seals, on the other hand, were affected by year, with individuals in 2002 having higher delta N-15 values. The median (with range) contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet of crabeater seals, as estimated using the Bayesian mixing model MixSIR, was 87.9\% (81.2 to 94.8\%). During 2002, krill biomass in the wAP was at one of its lowest levels during the last 2 decades, coinciding with a slight reduction in the importance of krill for the diet of the seals that year, which reached 84.5\% (75.1 to 92.4\%). Despite the relative plasticity observed in the diet of crabeater seals, it is unknown to what extent, and at what rate, crabeater seals might be able to switch to a more generalized diet, which might impact their fitness, given the ongoing environmental change along the wAP.},

Large loggerhead turtles showed little among-individual isotopic variance in skin samples, suggesting similar foraging or habitat use patterns over several months or more. Analysis of loggerhead foraging in video data, and comparison with isotopic variance for sympatric green turtles Chelonia mydas, suggest that low isotopic variance among large loggerheads reflects a similar, highly generalized diet within individuals. Higher isotopic variance among smaller turtles may reflect variation in diet, timing of recruitment to neritic habitat or use of food webs varying along other isotopic gradients. Loggerheads showed strong fidelity to the study site over many years, and individuals recaptured frequently showed remarkable affinity for very small geographic areas, often {\textless}5km(2). Thus, a substantial proportion of the Shark Bay loggerhead population comprises site specialists, with larger adults appearing to be diet generalists. Our results also suggest that among-individual isotopic variation found at some loggerhead nesting locations may reflect the isotopic characteristics of preferred migratory or foraging grounds owing to long-term site fidelity and less likely reflects prey specialization by individuals within specific feeding areas.},

ISSN 0392-6672. http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1827-806X.41.1.9 Cave-obligate organisms usually have smaller ranges and their assemblages have higher beta diversity than their epigean counterparts. Phylogenetic and functional diversity is usually low in cave communities, leading to taxonomic and functional disharmony, with entire groups missing from the subterranean realm. The objective of this work is to compare range, beta diversity, phylogenetic and functional diversity, taxonomic and functional disharmony of epigean versus troglobiont spiders in the Iberian Peninsula. The median extent of occurrence was found to be 33 times higher for epigean than for cave species. Beta diversity was significantly higher for troglobiont assemblages. Cave assemblages present lower phylogenetic and functional diversities than expected by chance. Taxonomic disharmony was noticeable, with many speciose families, namely Gnaphosidae, Salticidae and Lycosidae, absent in caves. Functional disharmony was equally high, with ambush hunters and sensing web weavers being absent in caves. The small range and high beta diversity of troglobiont spiders in the Iberian Peninsula is typical of many cave-obligate organisms, caused by the fragmentation and isolation of cave systems and the low vagility and high habitat specialization of species. Caves were colonized mainly by pre-adapted lineages, with high proportions of eutroglophile species. Some families no longer occur in surface habitats, possibly since the last glaciations, and currently are restricted to caves in the region. Few hunting strategies and web types are efficient in caves and these dominate among the troglobiont species. As troglobiont communities are of low alpha diversity, with low functional redundancy, have narrow ranges, present high levels of population fragmentation and are taxonomically unique, they should present higher proportions of imperilled species than epigean spiders in the Iberian Peninsula. Some species are probably endangered and require urgent conservation measures.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that pollinators vary in their effectiveness in pollination mutualisms, due both to differences in flower-pollinator morphological fit as well as pollinator behaviour. However, pollination webs typically treat all interactions as equal, and we contend that this method may provide misleading results. Using empirical and theoretical data, we present the case study of a self-incompatible herb in which the number of flowers visited by a pollinator cannot be used as a surrogate for the total effect of a pollinator on a plant due to differences in per-visit effectiveness at producing seeds. In self-incompatible species, the relationship between interaction frequency and per-interaction effect may become increasingly negative as more flowers per plant are visited due to geitonogamous pollen transfer. We found that pollinators making longer bouts (i.e. visiting more flowers per plant visit) had an overall higher pollination success per bout. However, per-interaction effects tended to decrease as the bout progressed, particularly for pollinators that cause higher pollen deposition. Since the same interaction frequency may result from different combinations of number of bouts (plant visits) and bout length (flowers visited/bout), pollinators making repeatedly shorter bouts may contribute more to plant reproduction for the same number of flowers visited. Consequently, the magnitude of the differences in number of interactions of different insect types may be overridden by the magnitude of the differences in effectiveness as pollinators, even if the same pollinators consistently interact more frequently. We discuss two predictions regarding the validity of using interaction frequency as a surrogate for plant seed production (as a measure of total effect), depending on the degree of self-compatibility, plant size and floral display. We suggest that the role of interaction frequency must be tested for different species, environments, and across wider scales to validate its use as a surrogate for total effect in plant-pollinator networks.},

We pay particular attention to those species that have undergone a relative enlargement of the telencephalon to determine whether this relative increase in telencephalic size is homogeneous across different brain regions or whether particular regions have become differentially enlarged. The analysis indicates that changes in the relative size of telencephalic regions are not homogeneous, with every species showing hypertrophy or hypotrophy of at least one of them. The three-dimensional structure of these regions in different species was also variable, in particular that of the mesopallium in kiwi. The findings from this study provide further evidence that the changes in relative brain size in birds reflect a process of mosaic evolution. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

This work is a primer of how stable isotope analysis can be used as a cost-effective, relatively simple tool for examining resource use patterns (e.g. diet, habitat) and generating relevant data in support of science-based elasmobranch conservation and management. Specifically, isotopes can resolve the feeding niches of elasmobranchs, detect ontogenetic trophic shifts and calculate relative diet breadth of different species. Stable isotope analysis can also be employed to investigate the extent of anthropogenic impacts on diet or to infer the source of toxins affecting elasmobranchs. Additionally, this tool can be used to study migration patterns and habitat usage. Depending on the tissue analysed, this technique can also be non-lethal and minimally invasive. The limitations of stable isotope analysis are discussed, and recommendations for future work are presented.},

Lionfish Pterois volitans/miles have spread throughout the Western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and they may have significant effects on native faunal communities. We characterized the trophic ecology of lionfish in back reef habitats on Abaco Island, Bahamas, drawing on recently developed analytical tools that employ both direct diet information and stable isotope data. Although delta N-15 and delta C-13 bi-plot data appeared to suggest substantial niche overlap with native gray snapper and schoolmaster snapper, Bayesian analytical tools suggested differences in core isotopic niches among the species. This was consistent with direct diet information, as lionfish fed almost exclusively on small prey fishes and snapper fed more commonly on crustaceans. When combining empirical isotope and diet data in a simulation model, individual lionfish appear to be more specialized in their diets than schoolmaster snapper. We suggest that this pattern may be driven by high site-fidelity of lionfish, in conjunction with distinct prey assemblages at the patch scale. Lionfish are widely considered to be generalist predators, and our data reveal aspects of this trophic generality that must be considered as the role of lionfish in their invaded habitats continues to be examined.},

Fish were caught between April 2008 and March 2009 using a variety of fishing gear. The analysis of 113 individuals revealed a diet essentially composed of fish (16 species), particularly characid species (9). The diet became more diverse and contained larger fish prey with increasing predator size. Feeding strategy analysis revealed a clear specialization towards the consumption of fish. However, individuals did not prey upon particular prey species, instead opportunistically consuming many different fish species, which could be a strategy to avoid intraspecific competition. Characid species were the most important prey, followed by poecillids. A multi-gear sampling of the ichthyofauna revealed that these prey species were the most abundant (Characidae: 61.3\%, Poeciliidae 18.8\%) of the 14 fish families occurring at the study site, suggesting that the predator exploits the most abundant fish resources available rather than the rarer fish prey. These findings suggest that potential top-down controls exerted by H. aff. malabaricus in this system follow specific food web pathways that seem to be mediated by the abundance of prey resources.},

A recent neural network model refined the predictions of this theory, indicating that a cognitive advantage in specialists is likely to occur under realistic ecological conditions, namely when 'mistakes' (i.e. selection of non-host resources) contribute moderately but positively to fitness. Here, we present a formal empirical test of the predictions of this model. Using a human-computer interactive, we demonstrate that the central prediction of the model is supported: specialist humans are more accurate decision-makers than generalists when their mistakes are rewarded, but not when mistakes are punished. The idea that increased decision accuracy drives the evolution of niche width in animals has been supported in almost all empirical systems in which it has been investigated. Theoretical work supports the idea, and now the predictions of a key theoretical model have been demonstrated in a real biological information-processing system. Considering these interlocking pieces of evidence, we argue that specialization through increased decision accuracy may contribute significantly, along with other mechanisms, to promote niche specialization in animals.},

	abstract = {Obtaining adequate dietary information for many shark and chimaera species has long been a challenge for ecosystem managers, largely due to logistical difficulties in the collection of large sample sizes required for stomach content analyses. Here, we use multivariate analysis of signature fatty acid (FA) profiles as a complementary method to examine the diet composition of 16 demersal shark and chimaera species, collected off south eastern Australia. Comparative results of FA profiles of potential prey and chondrichthyan species mostly agree with the stomach content data. Multivariate analysis correctly classified chimaeras as prominent low-order and benthic consumers, medium-sized dogfish as predators of mid-trophic fish and squid, catsharks as dominant cephalopod consumers, and larger and deeper dwelling dogfish as feeders of bathypelagic fish, squid and feeding on higher order species (cetaceans and seals). Our results demonstrate that signature FA analysis can be applied in dietary studies of sharks and chimaeras to (1) distinguish interspecific differences in general resource (diet and habitat) use patterns; (2) identify degrees of dietary specialisation: and (3) detect niche partitioning of resources by co-occurring species. The FA profiling approach is particularly valuable where sample numbers are likely to be low, such as for these deep-sea and threatened organisms. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Randomness in parasite co-occurrence was observed in most modules and component communities, although species segregation patterns were also observed. The low degree of connectance in the network may be the cause of properties such as nestedness and modularity, which indicate the presence of a high number of peripheral species. Segregation patterns among parasite species in modules underscore the role of host specificity.

	abstract = {1. The feeding range of an individual is central to food web dynamics as it determines the spatial scale of predator-prey interactions. However, despite recognition of its importance as a driving force in population dynamics, establishing feeding range is seldom done as detailed information on trophic interactions is difficult to obtain. 2. Biological markers are useful to answer this challenge as long as spatial heterogeneity in signal is present within the area investigated. A spatially complex ecosystem, Lake St. Pierre (LSP), a fluvial lake of the St Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada), offered a unique opportunity to determine the feeding range of a secondary consumer, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) using isotopic ratios of carbon (delta C-13). However, because food chains based on phytoplankton have generally more negative delta C-13 than those depending on periphyton, it was essential to determine the contribution of zooplankton in fish diet to correctly interpret spatial patterns of delta C-13. We used parasites in perch to examine whether their delta C-13 was reflecting local delta C-13 baseline conditions rather than a feeding specialization on zooplankton. 3. delta C-13 of primary consumers was highly variable and exhibited a striking gradient along the shore-channel axis, suggesting that delta C-13 should reflect an individual consumer's spatial position in LSP. 4. This strong isotopic gradient allowed us to estimate the spatial scale of the resources used by individual perch following an approach presented by Rasmussen, Trudeau \& Morinville (Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, 2009, 674). By comparing the delta C-13 variability in perch to that of primary consumers, we estimated that the adults feeding range was around 2 km along the shore-channel axis. 5. The combined use of isotopic ratios and parasites allowed us to determine that the adult population uses a wide range of habitats between the flood plain and the main channel. However, individually, each perch depended on a limited foodshed.},

This review details the composition of floral bouquets that elicit strong attraction in pollinators, demonstrating that for some species of plants the composition of the bouquet plays an important role in exploiting the insect's olfactory system, thereby driving innate attraction, whereas other bouquets can be learned as an associative cue for the nectar reward. By associative learning of nonattractive floral odors with a nectar reward-through octopamine-associated modulation of neurons in the antennal lobe-insects have the ability to exploit alternate floral resources when their preferred flowers are no longer present. Such neural mechanisms, present in specialist and generalist pollinators, provides the means by which pollination associations can range from specialized to generalized while permitting insects to exist within a dynamic floral environment.},

	abstract = {Network analyses have emerged as a new tool to study frugivory and seed dispersal (FSD) mutualisms because networks can model and simplify the complexity of multiple community-wide species interactions. Moreover, network theory suggests that structural properties, such as the presence of highly generalist species, are linked to the stability of mutualistic communities. However, we still lack empirical validation of network model predictions. Here we outline new research avenues to connect network models to FSD processes, and illustrate the challenges and opportunities of this tool with a field study. We hypothesized that generalist frugivores would be important for forest stability by dispersing seeds into deforested areas and initiating reforestation. We then constructed a network of plant-frugivore interactions using published data and identified the most generalist frugivores. To test the importance of generalists we measured: 1) the frequency with which frugivores moved between pasture and forest, 2) the bird-generated seed rain under perches in the pasture, and 3) the perching frequency of birds above seed traps. The generalist frugivores in the forest network were not important for seed dispersal into pastures, and thus for forest recovery, because the forest network excluded habitat heterogeneities, frugivore behavior, and movements. More research is needed to develop ways to incorporate relevant FSD processes into network models in order for these models to be more useful to community ecology and conservation. The network framework can serve to spark and renew interest in FSD and further our understanding of plant-animal communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

As climate-driven range dynamics should diminish local adaptations and favor generalization, one hypothesis is that contemporary biotic specialization is determined by the degree of past climatic instability, primarily Quaternary climate-change velocity. Other prominent hypotheses predict that either contemporary climate or species richness affect biotic specialization. To gain insight into geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization and its drivers, we use network analysis to determine the degree of specialization in plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks sampled at 31 localities, spanning a wide range of climate regimes across the Americas. We found greater biotic specialization at lower latitudes, with latitude explaining 20-22\% of the spatial variation in plant-hummingbird specialization. Potential drivers of specialization - contemporary climate, Quaternary climate-change velocity, and species richness -had superior explanatory power, together explaining 53-64\% of the variation in specialization. Notably, our data provides empirical evidence for the hypothesized roles of species richness, contemporary precipitation and Quaternary climate-change velocity as key predictors of biotic specialization, whereas contemporary temperature and seasonality seem unimportant in determining specialization. These results suggest that both ecological and evolutionary processes at Quaternary time scales can be important in driving large-scale geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization, at least for co-evolved systems such as plant-hummingbird networks.},

In contrast to a scenario of coevolution by race formation, we show that fragrance-producing orchids originated at least three times independently after their fragrance-collecting bee mutualists. Whereas orchid diversification has apparently tracked the diversification of orchids' bee pollinators, bees appear to have depended on the diverse chemical environment of neotropical forests. We corroborated this apparent asymmetrical dependency by simulating co-extinction cascades in real interaction networks that lacked reciprocal specialization.

The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents-mainly, new popular movements-of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave-"NGOization"-"and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society. Rather than NGOization related to the depoliticization and neoliberalization of civil society, in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, there has been modernization of organizational ecologies, changes in the functional status of civil society, and interestingly, specialization aimed at shaping public agenda. The authors argue that such specialization, instead of encumbering social change, brings about different repertoires of strategies and skills purposively developed for influencing policy and politics. Their argument relies on comparative systematic evidence. Through network analysis, they examine the organizational ecology of civil society in Mexico City and Sao Paulo.},

	abstract = {In networks of plant-animal mutualisms, different animal groups interact preferentially with different plants, thus forming distinct modules responsible for different parts of the service. However, what we currently know about seed dispersal networks is based only on birds. Therefore, we wished to fill this gap by studying bat-fruit networks and testing how they differ from bird-fruit networks. As dietary overlap of Neotropical bats and birds is low, they should form distinct mutualistic modules within local networks. Furthermore, since frugivory evolved only once among Neotropical bats, but several times independently among Neotropical birds, greater dietary overlap is expected among bats, and thus connectance and nestedness should be higher in bat-fruit networks. If bat-fruit networks have higher nestedness and connectance, they should be more robust to extinctions. We analyzed 1 mixed network of both bats and birds and 20 networks that consisted exclusively of either bats (11) or birds (9). As expected, the structure of the mixed network was both modular (M = 0.45) and nested (NODF = 0.31); one module contained only birds and two only bats. In 20 datasets with only one disperser group, bat-fruit networks (NODF = 0.53 +/- A 0.09, C = 0.30 +/- A 0.11) were more nested and had a higher connectance than bird-fruit networks (NODF = 0.42 +/- A 0.07, C = 0.22 +/- A 0.09). Unexpectedly, robustness to extinction of animal species was higher in bird-fruit networks (R = 0.60 +/- A 0.13) than in bat-fruit networks (R = 0.54 +/- A 0.09), and differences were explained mainly by species richness. These findings suggest that a modular structure also occurs in seed dispersal networks, similar to pollination networks. The higher nestedness and connectance observed in bat-fruit networks compared with bird-fruit networks may be explained by the monophyletic evolution of frugivory in Neotropical bats, among which the diets of specialists seem to have evolved from the pool of fruits consumed by generalists.},

	abstract = {Previously, host-parasitoid links have been unveiled almost exclusively by time-intensive rearing, while molecular methods were used only in simple agricultural host-parasitoid systems in the form of species-specific primers. Here, we present a general method for the molecular detection of these links applied to a complex caterpillar-parasitoid food web from tropical rainforest of Papua New Guinea. We DNA barcoded hosts, parasitoids and their tissue remnants and matched the sequences to our extensive library of local species. We were thus able to match 87\% of host sequences and 36\% of parasitoid sequences to species and infer subfamily or family in almost all cases. Our analysis affirmed 93 hitherto unknown trophic links between 37 host species from a wide range of Lepidoptera families and 46 parasitoid species from Hymenoptera and Diptera by identifying DNA sequences for both the host and the parasitoid involved in the interaction. Molecular detection proved especially useful in cases where distinguishing host species in caterpillar stage was difficult morphologically, or when the caterpillar died during rearing. We have even detected a case of extreme parasitoid specialization in a pair of Choreutis species that do not differ in caterpillar morphology and ecology. Using the molecular approach outlined here leads to better understanding of parasitoid host specificity, opens new possibilities for rapid surveys of food web structure and allows inference of species associations not already anticipated.},

Time of flower closure has been explained mainly by light in the traditional botanical literature. We show with a set of experiments that Asteraceae flower heads can close within three hours after pollination, whereas un-pollinated flower heads stay open until the late afternoon. This suggests that closing time strongly depends on pollinators. Using plant-pollinator interaction webs we further demonstrate that the daily pattern of flower opening and the rapid response to pollination can impose strong temporal dynamics on interspecific interactions within a single day. We observed pollinator species turnover and changes in facilitation vs. competition among plants. Our results show for the first time that pollination induces rapid flower closure on the community level. This causes imprecision in Linne's floral clock with far-reaching consequences for plant-pollinator interactions.},

We explore specialization and interaction patterns of fleas infesting non-volant small mammals in Bornean rainforests, using material from a field survey carried out in two montane localities in northwestern Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia) and from a literature database of all available interactions in both lowland and montane forests. A total of 234 flea individuals collected during our field survey resulted in an interaction network of eight flea species on seven live-captured small mammal species. The interaction network from all compiled studies currently includes 15 flea species and 16 small mammal species. Host specificity and niche partitioning of fleas infesting diurnal treeshrews and squirrels were low, with little difference in specialization among taxa, but host specificity in lowland forests was found to be higher than in montane forests. By contrast, Sigmactenus alticola (Siphonaptera: Leptopsyllidae) exhibited low host specificity by infesting various montane and lowland nocturnal rats. However, this species exhibited low niche partitioning as it was the only commonly recorded flea from rats on Borneo. Overall complementary specialization was of intermediate intensity for both networks and differed significantly from random association; this has important implications for specific interactions that are also relevant to the potential spread of vector-borne diseases.},

We used a carbon-based food web model of Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France) to investigate the effects of chytrids during the spring diatom bloom by developing models with and without chytrids. Linear inverse modelling procedures were employed to estimate undetermined flows in the lake. The Monte Carlo Markov chain linear inverse modelling procedure provided estimates of the ranges of model-derived fluxes. Model results support recent theories on the probable impact of parasites on food web function. In the lake, during spring, when 'inedible' algae (unexploited by planktonic herbivores) were the dominant primary producers, the epidemic growth of chytrids significantly reduced the sedimentation loss of algal carbon to the detritus pool through the production of grazer-exploitable zoospores. We also review some theories about the potential influence of parasites on ecological network properties and argue that parasitism contributes to longer carbon path lengths, higher levels of activity and specialization, and lower recycling. Considering the "structural asymmetry" hypothesis as a stabilizing pattern, chytrids should contribute to the stability of aquatic food webs.},

To better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of multispecies interactions, we explored linkages between soil fungi, pollinators, and floral larcenists in Polemonium viscosum (Polemoniaceae). Methods: Using a fungicide, we experimentally reduced fungal colonization of krummholz and tundra P. viscosum in 2008-2009. We monitored floral signals and rewards, interactions with pollinators and larcenists, and seed set for fungicide-treated and control plants. Key results: Fungicide effects varied among traits, between interactions, and with environmental context. Treatment effects were negligible in 2008, but stronger in 2009, especially in the less-fertile krummholz habitat. There, fungicide increased nectar sugar content and damage by larcenist ants, but did not affect pollination. Surprisingly, fungicide also enhanced seed set, suggesting that direct resource costs of soil fungi exceed indirect benefits from reduced larceny. In the tundra, fungicide effects were negligible in both years. However, pooled across treatments, colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in 2009 correlated negatively with the intensity and diversity of floral volatile organic compounds, suggesting integrated above-and belowground signaling pathways. Conclusions: Fungicide effects on floral rewards in P. viscosum link soil fungi to ecological costs of pollinator attraction. Trait-specific linkages to soil fungi should decouple expression of sensitive and buffered floral phenotypes in P. viscosum. Overall, this study demonstrates how multitrophic linkages may lead to shifting selection pressures on interaction traits, restricting the evolution of specialization.},

First, as the Hippopotamidae are the extant sister group of Cetacea, gaining a better understanding of the origin of the Hippopotamidae and of their Paleogene ancestors will be instrumental in clarifying phylogenetic relationships within Cetartiodactyla. Unfortunately, the data relevant to hippopotamid origins have generally been ignored in phylogenetic analyses of cetartiodactyls. In order to obtain better resolution, future analyses should consider hypotheses of hippopotamid Paleogene relationships. Notably, an emergence of the Hippopotamidae from within anthracotheriids has received growing support, leading to reconciliation between genetic and morphological evidence for the clade Cetancodonta (Hippopotamidae + Cetacea). Secondly, full account needs to be taken of the Hippopotamidae when studying the impact of environmental change on faunal evolution. This group of semi-aquatic large herbivores has a clear and distinct ecological role and a diverse and abundant fossil record, particularly in the African Neogene. We examine three major phases of hippopotamid evolution, namely the sudden appearance of hippopotamines in the late Miocene (the "Hippopotamine Event"), the subsequent rampant endemism in African basins, and the Pleistocene expansion of Hippopotamus. Each may have been influenced by multiple factors, including: late Miocene grass expansion, African hydrographical network disruption, and a unique set of adaptations that allowed Hippopotamus to respond efficiently to early Pleistocene environmental change. Thirdly, the fossil record of the Hippopotamidae documents the independent emergence of adaptive character complexes in relation to semiaquatic habits and in response to insular isolation. The semiaquatic specializations of fossil hippopotamids are particularly useful in interpreting the functional morphology and ecology of other, extinct groups of large semiaquatic herbivores. Hippopotamids can also serve as models to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of island mammals.},

Muscle isotopic signature was measured for each of 237 delipidated tissue samples from 27 fish species collected offshore Adelie Land, East Antarctica. Overall, delta C-13 values ranged from -25.3 parts per thousand to -18.2 parts per thousand, thus allowing characterizing of the fish habitats, with inshore/benthic species having more positive delta C-13 signatures than offshore/pelagic ones. No clear difference in the delta C-13 values of pelagic fishes was found between species living in neritic and oceanic waters. Overall, the delta N-15 signatures of neritic pelagic and epibenthic fishes encompassed similar to 1.0 trophic level (3.1 parts per thousand), a higher difference than that (1.4 parts per thousand) found within the oceanic assemblage. Fishes with the lowest and highest delta N-15 values are primarily invertebrate- and fish-eaters, respectively. The isotopic niches of fishes illustrate the different mechanisms allowing coexistence, with most fishes segregating at least by one of the two niche axes ( delta C-13 and delta N-15). Muscle isotopic values also document interindividual foraging specialization over the long-term in coastal benthic fishes, but not in more offshore pelagic species. Finally, the delta N-15 signatures of fishes overlap with those of penguins and seals, indicating that seabirds and marine mammals share the upper levels of the Antarctic pelagic ecosystem with some large fish species. In conclusion, the concept of isotopic niche is a powerful tool to investigate various aspects of the ecological niche of Antarctic fishes, thus complementing the use of other conventional and non-conventional approaches.

The study included all beetles in the subfamily Cassidinae (Chrysomelidae) found feeding on common monocotyledonous plants in the Tropical forest understorey and edge habitats. 3. Nestedness, a structural property common to many food webs, was not observed in this study, however strong evidence for a modular structure was uncovered. 4. Our findings suggest the feeding niches of hispine beetles are constrained within module boundaries, which largely correspond to plant ordinal and familial limits, and secondarily to plant attributes, including the morphology of immature leaves. 5. We conclude that modularity in this food web is largely a product of narrow, discrete hispine beetle host specificity for larger phylogenetically related plant taxa.},

The role of pollinators in the evolution of floral traits has been questioned recently by broad community surveys, especially studies concerning variation in pollinator assemblages and visitation frequency, which suggest a diminished role of pollinators in floral evolution. Here, we investigate the relationships between six categories of floral traits of 29 species and 10 pollinator functional groups in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains of China, over three consecutive years. Simpson's diversity index was used to estimate the level of pollinator generalization of each plant species by considering both pollinator groups and their relative visitation frequencies. Multivariate analyses indicated that eight of the ten pollinator groups showed constant preferences for at least two floral traits, leading to a relatively stable level of ecological generalization for most floral traits (two out of three categories), despite the fact that the level of generalization of the entire community varied across years. Shape preferences of butterflies, honeybees and beeflies varied such that open flowers exhibited a lower level of ecological generalization in 2007 than closed flowers, in contrast with the other 2 years. These results suggest that temporally stabilized preferences of diverse pollinators may contribute to the evolution of specialized versus generalized floral traits; however, their role may be moderated by variation in community structure, including both the composition and abundance of plants and pollinators.},

	abstract = {One of the most consensual ecological effects of the current climate warming is the alteration of the environmental timing of ecosystems. Phenological shifts, at different levels of food webs, are predicted to have major effects on species assemblages. Indeed it is unlikely that all species should be able to respond to the phenological shifts of their environment evenly. Yet questions remain about the specific traits that predict the ability of a species to track the temporal fluctuations of its environment. In this study, we use data from the French Constant Effort Site ringing program over a 20 years period (1989-2008) to estimate the ability of 20 common passerine species to adjust their breeding phenology to spring temperature variations. We show that the sensitivity of species breeding phenology to climate relates to species mean migration distance, species' thermal and habitat niche breadth and brain mass. Species with the broadest ecological and thermal niches, the shortest mean migration distances and the largest brains were most able to adjust their breeding phenology to temperature variations. Our results thus identify long distance migrants and ecological specialists as species that could most suffer from the future expected climate change and suggests phenological adjustment as one possible mechanism underlying the replacement of specialist species by more generalist ones, the so called functional biotic homogenization.},

Highly mobile top predators are hypothesized to spatially and/or temporally link disparate habitats through the combination of their movement and feeding patterns, but recent studies suggest that individual specialization in habitat use and feeding could keep habitats compartmentalized. 2. We used passive acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to investigate whether specialization in movement and feeding patterns of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in an oligotrophic subtropical estuary created habitat linkages between marine and estuarine/freshwater food webs. 3. Individual alligators adopted one of the three relatively distinct movement tactics that were linked to variation in diets. Fifty-six per cent of alligators regularly travelled from the upstream (freshwater/mid-estuary) areas into the downstream (marine-influenced) areas where salinities exceed those typically tolerated by alligators. Thirty-one per cent of the alligators made regular trips from the mid-estuarine habitat into the upstream habitat; 13\% remained in the mid-estuary zone year-round. 4. Stable isotopic analysis indicated that, unlike individuals remaining in the mid-estuary and upstream zones, alligators that used the downstream zone fed at least partially from marine food webs and likely moved to access higher prey abundance at the expense of salt stress. Therefore, 'commuting' alligators may link marine food webs with those of the estuary and marshes in the coastal Everglades and create an upstream vector for allochthonous nutrient inputs into the estuary. 5. This study lends further support to the hypothesis that large-bodied highly mobile predators faced with trade-offs are likely to exhibit individual specialization leading to habitat linkages, rather than compartmentalization. However, the conditions under which this scenario occurs require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks are asymmetric in their interactions: specialist plants are pollinated by generalist animals, while generalist plants are pollinated by a broad range involving specialists and generalists. It has been suggested that this asymmetric -or disassortative- assemblage could play an important role in determining the observed equal susceptibility of specialist and generalist plants under habitat destruction. At the core of the analysis of the phenomenon lies the observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction, could cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with a few generalist pollinators. We present a theoretical framework that supports this thesis. We analyze a dynamical model of a system of mutualistic plants and pollinators, subject to the destruction of their habitat. We analyze and compare two families of interaction topologies, ranging from highly assortative to highly disassortative ones, as well as real pollination networks. We found that several features observed in natural systems are predicted by the mathematical model. First, there is a tendency to increase the asymmetry of the network as a result of the extinctions. Second, an entropy measure of the differential susceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist species show that they tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally, the disappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that specialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an assortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption.},

These included the upper and lower reaches of the river, the estuary, a connected ditch network and a coastal salt marsh. We found significant habitat-specific differences in morphology, with three axes of variation describing differences in orbit diameter, body depth, caudal peduncle shape and pectoral fin positioning as well as variation in relative dorsal and pelvic spine size. Interestingly, the ditch system, an artificial and heavily managed habitat, is populated by sticklebacks with a characteristic morphology, suggesting that human management of habitats can in some circumstances lead to morphological variation among the animals that inhabit them. We discuss the mechanisms that conceivably underlie the observed morphological variation and the further work necessary to identify them.

Aims: To evaluate physician attitudes in the management of VKAs-associated coagulopathy in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and to assess their compliance to current practice guidelines. Design: Cross sectional physician web-based survey amongst regional members of three Italian Gastroenterological Societies (AIGO, SIED, SIGE) practicing in academic medical centres or community hospitals. Physicians were asked to provide management preferences in four hypothetical case-scenarios describing patients with warfarin-associated coagulopathy presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding of varying severity. Results: A total of 105 out of 238 (48\%) members responded; mean age +/- SD: 46.3 +/- 9.8 years, 68\% male. The adherence to practice guidelines for the reversal of warfarin-induced anticoagulation ranged from 24\% to 86\% and it was not dependent on age, years and type of specialisation, hospital setting and active performance of "on call" emergency endoscopy or not. Conclusions: There is a considerable variability amongst physicians in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding patients with VKAs-associated coagulopathy and a poor compliance to practice guidelines. These data indicate that better education is needed in this area. (C) 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between flowers and insect visitors. They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of insect-flower interaction networks. 2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insect-flower interaction network size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland. 3. We found that insect-flower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant/animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously documented insect-flower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, suggesting organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited. 4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of insect-flower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks (organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low plant/animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environmental schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can be made for this group. We conclude that organic farming, although not the solution in its present form, can benefit insect biodiversity, insect-flower interaction networks and insect-mediated pollination.},

Although the stoichiometry of heterotrophs is generally considered to vary only little, there may be intraspecific variation due to factors such as habitat, resources, ontogeny and size. We examined intraspecific variation in Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis stoichiometry, a common species that exhibits habitat and resource specialization, ontogenetic niche shifts and a large size range. This study investigated the elemental stoichiometry of a wide size range of perch from littoral and pelagic habitats. The mean C:N:P stoichiometry of whole perch was 37:9:1 (molar ratios). However, \%C, \%P, C:N, C:P and N:P varied with size, morphology, habitat and diet category. These factors together explained 24-40\% of the variation in C:N:P stoichiometry. In contrast, perch stoichiometry was not related to diet stoichiometry, suggesting that the former is homeostatically regulated. The results suggest that the high P content of perch may result in stoichiometric constraints on the growth of non-piscivorous perch, and that piscivory is an efficient strategy for acquiring P. Resource polymorphism, individual diet specialization and intraspecific size variation are widespread among animals. Thus changes in stoichiometry with size, habitat, morphology and resource use, and therefore also stoichiometric demands, are probably common.},

Epiphyte-host networks from old-growth forests differed from those from disturbed forest in several topological parameters based on both qualitative and quantitative matrices. Network robustness increased with network size, but the slope of this relationship varied with nestedness and connectance.

	abstract = {Aim We analysed variation in chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) in red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) across a large part of their geographic ranges. Acer rubrum is one of the most common and morphologically variable deciduous trees of eastern North America, while its sister species A. saccharinum has a more restricted habitat distribution and displays markedly less morphological variation. Our objective was to infer the impact of biogeographic history on cpDNA diversity and phylogeographic structure in both species. Location Deciduous forests of eastern North America. Methods We sequenced 1289 to 1645 bp of non-coding cpDNA from A. rubrum (n = 258) and A. saccharinum (n = 83). Maximum parsimony networks and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) were used to analyse phylogeographic structure. Rarefaction analyses were used to compare genetic diversity. Results A total of 40 cpDNA haplotypes were recovered from A. rubrum (38 haplotypes) and A. saccharinum (7 haplotypes). Five of the seven A. saccharinum haplotypes were shared with nearby samples of A. rubrum. SAMOVA recovered four phylogeographic groups for A. rubrum in: (1) south-eastern USA, (2) the Gulf and south-eastern Coastal Plain, (3) the lower Mississippi River Valley, and (4) the central and northern regions of eastern North America. Acer saccharinum had significantly lower haplotype diversity than A. rubrum, and novel haplotypes in post-glaciated northern limits of its range were shared with A. rubrum. Main conclusions This is the first study of A. rubrum to report a distinct phylogeographic group centred on the lower Mississippi River, and the first to examine data comparatively with A. saccharinum. We hypothesized that A. rubrum would display stronger phylogeographic structure and greater haplotype diversity than A. saccharinum because of its greater geographic range, and ecological and morphological variation. This hypothesis was supported by the cpDNA analysis. The sharing of cpDNA and chloroplast simple sequence repeat (cpSSR) haplotypes in areas of geographic overlap provides evidence of introgression, which led to an increase in haplotype diversity in both species, and to novel phylogeographic structure in A. rubrum. We recommend that introgression be considered, along with other potential causes, as an explanation for the phylogeographic structure of cpDNA in plants.},

	abstract = {There is now strong evidence that foraging niche specialisation plays a critical role in the very early stages of resource driven speciation. Here we test critical elements of models defining this process using a known polymorphic population of Arctic charr from subarctic Norway. We test the long-term stability of niche specialisation amongst foraging predators and discuss the possibility that contrasting foraging specialists are exposed to differing selection regimes. Inter-individual foraging niche stability was measured by combining two time-integrated ecological tracers of the foraging niche (each individual's delta(13)C and delta(15)N stable isotope (SI) signatures and their food borne parasite fauna) with a short-term measure of foraging niche use (stomach contents composition). Three dietary subgroups of predators were identified, including zooplankton, gammarid and benthivore specialists foragers. Zooplanktivorous specialists had muscle low in delta (13)C, a high abundance of parasites transmitted from pelagic copepods, a smaller head, longer snout and a more slender body-form than gammaridivorous specialist individuals which had muscle more enriched in delta (13)C and high abundance of parasites transmitted from benthic Gammarus. Benthivorous individuals were intermediate between the other two foraging groups according to muscle SI-signals (delta(13)C) and loadings of parasites transmitted from both copepods and Gammarus. The close relationship between subgroups identified by stomach contents, time-integrated tracers of niche use (SI and parasites) and functional trophic morphology (niche adaptations) demonstrate a long-term temporally stable niche use of each individual predator. Differential habitat use and contrasting parasite communities and loadings, show differential exposure to different suites of selection pressures for different foraging specialists. Results also show that individual specialisation in trophic behaviour and thus exposure to different suites of selection pressures are stable over time, and thus provide a platform for disruptive selection to operate within this sympatric system.},

Although these developments have provided ecologists with new perspectives, their full impact has been hampered by an inability to statistically compare individual communities using descriptive metrics. 2. We solve these issues by reformulating the metrics in a Bayesian framework. This reformulation takes account of uncertainty in the sampled data and naturally incorporates error arising from the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics. 3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics as an alternative to the currently employed Convex Hull methods when applied to single community members. We show that unlike Convex Hulls, the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4. These new metrics, which we call SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R), open up more avenues for direct comparison of isotopic niches across communities. The computational code to calculate the new metrics is implemented in the free-to-download package Stable Isotope Analysis for the R statistical environment.},

Degree distributions have been studied in a range of ecological networks, including both mutualistic bipartite networks of plants and pollinators or seed dispersers and antagonistic bipartite networks of plants and their consumers. The shape of a degree distribution, for example whether it follows an exponential or power-law form, is typically taken to be indicative of the processes structuring the network. The skewed degree distributions of bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic networks are usually assumed to show that ecological or co-evolutionary processes constrain the relative numbers of specialists and generalists in the network. I show that a simple null model based on the principle of maximum entropy cannot be rejected as a model for the degree distributions in most of the 115 bipartite ecological networks tested here. The model requires knowledge of the number of nodes and links in the network, but needs no other ecological information. The model cannot be rejected for 159 (69\%) of the 230 degree distributions of the 115 networks tested. It performed equally well on the plant and animal degree distributions, and cannot be rejected for 81 (70\%) of the 115 plant distributions and 78 (68\%) of the animal distributions. There are consistent differences between the degree distributions of mutualistic and antagonistic networks, suggesting that different processes are constraining these two classes of networks. Fit to the MaxEnt null model is consistently poor among the largest mutualistic networks. Potential ecological and methodological explanations for deviations from the model suggest that spatial and temporal heterogeneity are important drivers of the structure of these large networks.},

Such perspectives are crucial given the rapid environmental changes associated with habitat loss, climate change, and biological invasions, which we discuss in this context.

Therefore, we aimed at filling part of this gap by investigating bat-fruit networks. It is known from population studies that: (i) some bat species depend more on fruits than others, and (ii) that some specialized frugivorous bats prefer particular plant genera. We tested whether those preferences affected the structure and robustness of the whole network and the functional roles of species. Nine bat-fruit datasets from the literature were analyzed and all networks showed lower complementary specialization (H-2' = 0.3760.10, mean 6 SD) and similar nestedness (NODF = 0.5660.12) than pollination networks. All networks were modular (M=0.32 +/- 0.07), and had on average four cohesive subgroups (modules) of tightly connected bats and plants. The composition of those modules followed the genus-genus associations observed at population level (Artibeus-Ficus, Carollia-Piper, and Sturnira-Solanum), although a few of those plant genera were dispersed also by other bats. Bat-fruit networks showed high robustness to simulated cumulative removals of both bats (R = 0.55 +/- 0.10) and plants (R = 0.68 +/- 0.09). Primary frugivores interacted with a larger proportion of the plants available and also occupied more central positions; furthermore, their extinction caused larger changes in network structure. We conclude that bat-fruit networks are highly cohesive and robust mutualistic systems, in which redundancy is high within modules, although modules are complementary to each other. Dietary specialization seems to be an important structuring factor that affects the topology, the guild structure and functional roles in bat-fruit networks.},

Although studies have assessed several aspects of fisheries institutional structures, very few have looked at the impact of social network structure. In this study, we found evidence for the perceived effectiveness of A Joint Strategic Plan for Management of Great Lakes Fisheries in its social network structure. We focused on the frequency of interactions for exchanging information about Great Lakes fish stocks in general and lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in particular. These informational exchanges correspond to distinct social network structures, the fish stocks network and the lake sturgeon network. Similarities in participants' attributes and perceptions about fisheries governance may have facilitated the formation of social ties within these networks. The lake sturgeon network had significant subgroups wherein flow was more concentrated. The formation of these subgroups appears to have been influenced by individuals' employer type, committee affiliation, and perception about lake sturgeon governance. These subgroups were found to have 11 central individuals and two central subgroups. When comparing the central and noncentral individuals' attributes and perceptions, we did not find a significant difference that explains why the 11 individuals were central. Similarly, no significant differences were found in comparing the central and noncentral subgroups. In assessing the flow of information within and across these subgroups, we found that it was evenly distributed with some specialization of flow between subgroups, the latter probably related to the presence of bridging individuals connecting the subgroups.},

	abstract = {Killer whales Orcinus orca are sighted regularly off Shetland, UK, but little is known about their numbers, diet and population identity. We aimed to relate vocal behaviour to diet of killer whales around Shetland in order to investigate population structure and differences in feeding strategies. Fieldwork was conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009. We located killer whales through a sightings network and shore-based scans and collected photo-ID data, behavioural information, feeding data and acoustic recordings from a small boat. The majority of encounters (n = 14) were of small groups (1 to 15 individuals) travelling close to shore and feeding on marine mammals. Two encounters were with large groups (20+ individuals) feeding on herring Clupea harengus farther offshore. Seal-hunting groups vocalised rarely, producing pulsed calls, echolocation clicks and whistles almost exclusively when surface-active or milling after a kill. Herring-eating groups were largely silent during one encounter, but very vocal during the other. Analysis of pulsed calls identified 6 stereotyped call types for seal-hunting groups and 7 for herring-eating groups. No call types were shared between both kinds of groups. The vocal behaviour of seal-hunting groups showed striking parallels to that of Pacific marine mammal specialists and presumably evolved to decrease detection by acoustically sensitive prey. One call type produced by Shetland herring-eating killer whales matched a vocalisation that a previous study had described from Iceland and identified as a possible herding call that may function to concentrate herring during feeding. These findings point to behavioural and dietary specialisation among Shetland killer whales, which should be taken into account when making management decisions affecting these animals.},

Scale leads to product markets, specialised firms, channels, and to industries. Diversity generates peasant markets, shopping malls, and business eco-systems. These outcomes are all examples of marketing systems, and are typical of the patterns that emerge, grow, adapt and evolve in complex transaction flows. Marketing systems are multi-level, path dependent, dynamic systems, embedded within a social matrix, and interacting with institutional and knowledge environments. The purpose of this paper is to outline a number of propositions that might serve as a basis for a theory of marketing systems. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on historical research into the evolution of exchange and on examples of markets and exchange practices from marketing, anthropology, sociology, and economics. It utilises results from complex adaptive systems theory, from the networks and markets literatures, and from ecology, to formulate a series of propositions that identify properties believed to be common to all marketing systems. Findings - Marketing systems are identified and categorized as emergent patterns in flows of transactions. In total, 12 foundational propositions are suggested. The propositions are complementary to those suggested by S-D logic. Originality/value - This paper offers a fresh approach to the study of marketing systems, developing relevant theory. Marketing systems link micro choices with macro outcomes, with implications ranging from disaster recovery to distributive justice and QOL outcomes.},

Using stable isotopic analysis and stomach content analysis, we examined dietary niche overlap within a diverse elasmobranch mesopredator community in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Isotopic values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were consistent with most species being highly dependent on a seagrass-based food web. Differences were observed between the mean isotopic values of species, but there was a great deal of overlap in the isotopic niche space used by the community when examined at the level of individuals. Stomach contents also suggest dietary overlap among the diets of Himantura spp. and Glaucostegus typus, which contained many of the same prey species, primarily crustaceans typically associated with seagrass habitats, although in different proportions. Diet data also suggest that, despite having isotopic values similar to other species, Pastinachus atrus appears to feed on sandflat-associated species. In this community, variation within the groups examined, possibly due to individual specialization, appears to result in high resource overlap and may be a key component allowing for high diversity in this system and is perhaps crucial to understanding the role of mesopredators in community trophic dynamics.},

	abstract = {Ecological niche breadth (specialisation) and niche differentiation (complementarity) play a key role for species coexistence and hence biodiversity. Some niche dimensions of a species represent ecosystem functions or services such as pollination (functional niche). When species differ in their contribution to some collective function (functional complementarity), this implies that functions from several species are required for a high overall functional performance level. Applied to plant pollinator interactions, functional complementary suggests that a higher diversity of pollinators contributes to an increased pollination success of the plants or, in turn, that a higher diversity of flowers may better sustain the consumers' requirements. Complementarity can affect functioning at different scales: the collective functioning of the target community, a single species, an individual or even a part of the individual, e.g. a single flower. Recent network analyses revealed that plant pollinator interactions display a relatively high extent of complementary specialisation at the community scale. We propose several mechanisms that generate complementarity. From the consumers' viewpoint, differences in flowering phenology and/or nutritional variation in floral resources (nectar, pollen) may explain a complementary role of different flower species. From the plant's viewpoint, temporal or environmental variation in the pollinator species' activities may contribute to complementary effects on pollination of plant communities. In addition, different species may also pollinate either more exposed or more sheltered flowers from the same plant individual, or vary in their functions within single flowers. So far, empirical evidence for complementary effects in general, and particularly mechanistic explanations of such effects are scant and will require comparative investigations at multiple scales in the future. Such studies will help us to understand if and how biodiversity maintains the quality and quantity of plant pollinator functional relationships.},

	doi = {10.1890/09-1842.1},
	abstract = {The degree of interdependence and potential for shared coevolutionary history of frugivorous animals and fleshy-fruited plants are contentious topics. Recently, network analyses revealed that mutualistic relationships between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivores are mostly built upon generalized associations. However, little is known about the determinants of network structure, especially from tropical forests where plants' dependence on animal seed dispersal is particularly high. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of specialization and interaction strength in a plant-frugivore network from a Kenyan rain forest. We recorded fruit removal from 33 plant species in different forest strata (canopy, midstory, understory) and habitats (primary and secondary forest) with a standardized sampling design (3447 interactions in 924 observation hours). We classified the 88 frugivore species into guilds according to dietary specialization (14 obligate, 28 partial, 46 opportunistic frugivores) and forest dependence (50 forest species, 38 visitors). Overall, complementary specialization was similar to that in other plant-frugivore networks. However, the plant-frugivore interactions in the canopy stratum were less specialized than in the mid-and understory, whereas primary and secondary forest did not differ. Plant specialization on frugivores decreased with plant height, and obligate and partial frugivores were less specialized than opportunistic frugivores. The overall impact of a frugivore increased with the number of visits and the specialization on specific plants. Moreover, interaction strength of frugivores differed among forest strata. Obligate frugivores foraged in the canopy where fruit resources were abundant, whereas partial and opportunistic frugivores were more common on mid-and understory plants, respectively. We conclude that the vertical stratification of the frugivore community into obligate and opportunistic feeding guilds structures this plant-frugivore network. The canopy stratum comprises stronger links and generalized associations, whereas the lower strata are composed of weaker links and more specialized interactions. Our results suggest that seed-dispersal relationships of plants in lower forest strata are more prone to disruption than those of canopy trees.},

We manipulated flowering onset in greenhouses and then observed pollinator visitation in the field. Five of six species with historically advanced flowering received more visits when flowering was experimentally advanced, whereas seven of eight species with historically unchanged flowering received fewer visits when flowering earlier. This pattern suggests that species unconstrained by pollinators have advanced their flowering, whereas species constrained by pollinators have not. In contrast to current concern about phenological mismatches disrupting plant-pollinator mutualisms, mismatches at the onset of flowering are not occurring for most of our study species.},

But there is increasing evidence that individual level dietary specialization may be common in many species, and this has not been investigated for many marine apex predators. 2. Because of their position at or near the top of many marine food webs, and the possibility that they can affect populations of their prey and induce trophic cascades, it is important to understand patterns of dietary specialization in shark populations. 3. Stable isotope values from body tissues with different turnover rates were used to quantify patterns of individual specialization in two species of 'generalist' sharks (bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, and tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier). 4. Despite wide population-level isotopic niche breadths in both species, isotopic values of individual tiger sharks varied across tissues with different turnover rates. The population niche breadth was explained mostly by variation within individuals suggesting tiger sharks are true generalists. In contrast, isotope values of individual bull sharks were stable through time and their wide population level niche breadth was explained by variation among specialist individuals. 5. Relative resource abundance and spatial variation in food-predation risk tradeoffs may explain the differences in patterns of specialization between shark species. 6. The differences in individual dietary specialization between tiger sharks and bull sharks results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. 7. Individual specialization may be an important feature of trophic dynamics of highly mobile marine top predators and should be explicitly considered in studies of marine food webs and the ecological role of top predators.},

The paper's analysis, with examples from Brittany, opens up a certain number of principles which can serve as a guideline in territorial development: acceptable scale of development, adjustment to land resources, and maintenance of multi-functionality, maximum threshold of specialization. This is necessary if we are to better understand, and then implement: an acceptable scale of development, adjustment to land resources, maintenance of multi-functionality. The landscape expertise might then be useful not only for landscape protection and planning, but also to consider broad lines of future development adapted to the 'sense of place', thus improving economic, ecological and social values. At a theoretical level, this analysis proposes an approach to territorial dynamics via the interaction of three concepts: resilience of territory, remanence of landscapes and resistance of people.},

However, ecological studies traditionally overlook individual differences. delta C-13 and delta N-15 were used in conjunction with diet and movement information to identify intrapopulation differences in diet and movement patterns of the apex predator broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus in southeast Tasmania. Sevengill samples from 3 inshore and 3 offshore sites were collected, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 compared between sites, sizes and sexes. Individuals captured offshore had lower delta N-15 than those captured inshore, indicating some degree of spatial segregation. Sevengills also had variable delta C-13 and delta N-15 within coastal habitats, suggesting intrapopulation differences in diet or migration schedules. In comparison to their main prey, most individuals had delta N-15 lower than expected for a top predator, also suggesting that they do not reside permanently in these areas, as their tissue was not in isotopic equilibrium with their known prey. This is in agreement with tracking data that showed seasonal use of coastal areas, with most animals leaving for the colder months but returning the following year. There was also a group of females with relatively high delta C-13 that suggests greater association to coastal habitats, again in agreement with tracking data, as some tagged females remained in the coastal areas over winter. Overall, together with diet and tracking information, results indicate that there are differences in movement and possibly diet in this sevengill population. This multi-methods approach allowed a better understanding of sevengill ecology than the use of any one of the techniques alone.},

We used stomach contents and stable isotope analyses to determine the diet of lionfish in the warm-temperate hard bottom reef community in the Southeast US Atlantic Ocean. During June to August 2004 and 2006, we collected lionfish with SCUBA from 18 different locations in Onslow Bay, North Carolina, at depths of 30 to 45 m. In 2006, we also conducted visual surveys of small benthic fishes to estimate the abundances of potential prey. Analyses of stomach contents (n = 183) and stable isotopes (n = 115) suggest a generalist carnivorous diet, and prey categories were predominately fish (similar to 99\% of total volume) from 16 families. Major differences in the importance of prey occurred between years. Serranidae and Scaridae dominated the diet in 2004, while Haemulidae and Carangidae were important in 2006. Analyses of visual prey surveys did not reveal specialization on particular prey taxa but instead suggest that prey are consumed in relation to their local abundance. Given current theory pertaining to invasive species impacts, the expanding lionfish distribution, and observations that lionfish appear capable of settling to many different habitat types, the overall pattern of generalist piscivory emerging from these data indicates the potential for significant impacts to the invaded community.},

Here, we used a network analysis approach to investigate orchid mycorrhizal associations in 16 species of the genus Orchis sampled across 11 different regions in Europe. We first examined in detail the structure of the network of associations and then tested for a phylogenetic signal in mycorrhizal specificity and identified the fungi with which the orchids associated. We found 20 different fungal lineages that associated with species of the genus Orchis, most of them being related to members of the Tulasnellaceae (84.33\% of all identified associations) and a smaller proportion being related to members of the Ceratobasidiaceae (9.97\%). Species associations formed a nested network that is built on asymmetric links among species. Evolution of mycorrhizal specificity in Orchis closely resembles a Brownian motion process, and the interaction between Orchis and Tulasnellaceae fungi is significantly influenced by the phylogenetic relationships between the Orchis species. Our results provide evidence of the presence of phylogenetic conservatism in mycorrhizal specificity in orchids and demonstrate that evolutionary processes may be an important factor in generating patterns of mycorrhizal associations.},

	abstract = {Network approaches have become a popular tool for understanding ecological complexity in a changing world. Many network descriptors relate directly or indirectly to specialization, which is a central concept in ecology and measured in different ways. Unfortunately, quantification of specialization and network structure using field data can suffer from sampling effects. Previous studies evaluating such sampling effects either used field data where the true network structure is unknown, or they simulated sampling based on completely generalized interactions. Here, we used a quantitative niche model to generate bipartite networks representing a wide range of specialization and evaluated potential sampling biases for a large set of specialization and network metrics for different network sizes. We show that with sample sizes realistic for species-rich networks, all metrics are biased towards overestimating specialization (and underestimating generalization and niche overlap). Importantly, this sampling bias depends on the true degree of specialization and is strongest for generalized networks. We show that methods used for empirical data may misrepresent sampling bias: null models simulating generalized interactions may overestimate bias, whereas richness estimators may strongly overestimate sampling completeness. Some network metrics are barely related between small and large sub-samples of the same network and thus may often not be meaningful. Small samples also overestimate interspecific variation of specialization within generalized networks. While new approaches to deal with these challenges have to be developed, we also identify metrics that are relatively unbiased and fairly consistent across sampling intensities and we identify a provisional rule of thumb for the number of observations required for accurate estimates. Our quantitative niche model can help understand variation in network structure capturing both sampling effects and biological meaning. This is needed to connect network science to fundamental ecological theory and to give robust quantitative answers for applied ecological problems.},

	abstract = {Sampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions. While the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of interactions among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e. ) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, that is life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically , resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance. Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to species inventories, a sizable fraction of non-observed pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological constraints that forbid their occurrence. Reasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the unobserved links when addressing sampling effort. Recent implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or for individual-based data can be combined with the assessment of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic estimate of interaction richness in a robustly sampled assemblage and the maximum richness of interactions. This is crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of defaunation-driven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.

Simple structural models produce gradient, compartmented or nested patterns of interaction; intermediate patterns between a gradient and compartments are possible, and nesting within compartments produces a combined model. Interaction patterns can be visualized and analyzed either as matrices, as bipartite networks or as multivariate sets through correspondence analysis. We argue that differences among patterns represent outcomes of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes in these highly diversified assemblages. Instead of choosing one model a priori, assemblages should be probed for a suite of patterns. A plant–pollinator assemblage exemplifies a simple nested pattern, whereas a plant–herbivore assemblage illustrates a compound pattern with nested structures within compartments. Compartmentation should reflect coevolutionary histories and constraints, whereas differences in species abundance or dispersal may generate nestedness.},

Some studies argue that those topologies result from selection against unstable networks, and others propose that they likely emerge from processes driving the interactions between pairs of species. Here we present a model that simulates the evolution of consumer species using resource species following simple rules derived from the integrative hypothesis of specialization (IHS). Without any selection on stability, our model reproduced all commonly observed network topologies. Our simulations demonstrate that resource heterogeneity drives network topology. On the one hand, systems containing only homogeneous resources form generalized nested networks, in which generalist consumers have higher performance on each resource than specialists. On the other hand, heterogeneous systems tend to have a compound topology: modular with internally nested modules, in which generalists that divide their interactions between modules have low performance. Our results demonstrate that all real-world topologies likely emerge through processes driving interactions between pairs of species. Additionally, our simulations suggest that networks containing similar species differ from heterogeneous networks and that modules may not present the topology of entire networks.},

	abstract = {Nestedness analysis has become increasingly popular in the study of biogeographic patterns of species occurrence. Nested patterns are those in which the species composition of small assemblages is a nested subset of larger assemblages. For species interaction networks such as plant–pollinator webs, nestedness analysis has also proven a valuable tool for revealing ecological and evolutionary constraints. Despite this popularity, there has been substantial controversy in the literature over the best methods to define and quantify nestedness, and how to test for patterns of nestedness against an appropriate statistical null hypothesis. Here we review this rapidly developing literature and provide suggestions and guidelines for proper analyses. We focus on the logic and the performance of different metrics and the proper choice of null models for statistical inference. We observe that traditional ‘gap-counting’ metrics are biased towards species loss among columns (occupied sites) and that many metrics are not invariant to basic matrix properties. The study of nestedness should be combined with an appropriate gradient analysis to infer possible causes of the observed presence–absence sequence. In our view, statistical inference should be based on a null model in which row and columns sums are fixed. Under this model, only a relatively small number of published empirical matrices are significantly nested. We call for a critical reassessment of previous studies that have used biased metrics and unconstrained null models for statistical inference.},

The maintenance of biodiversity and many ecosystem functions depend upon these ecological interactions. Humans, their crops and livestock can also be considered as part of these networks of interactions making network analysis valuable for considering the resilience of ecosystem services, i.e., the benefits we gain from nature. Networks are visually appealing and visualisation can attract attention and inform, both to communicate overall messages and provide comparisons between networks. There are many different approaches and layouts for visualising networks, but there is little research to help guide best practice. Ultimately though, best practice should be to ensure that messages are supported by evidence and clearly communicated with reference to the competence of the audience. Given the appeal of visualisations and the importance of networks in communicating the interdependence of species (including humans), ecological networks and their visualisation can be used to support excellent public engagement and can be used to enhance the value of citizen science, in which people actively contribute to scientific research. Network approaches could also be valuable for engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders, including their application to complex socio-economic systems, especially where co-production of network visualisations could provide evidence-based overviews of data. In summary, ecological networks and their visualisation are an important tool for scientific inquiry, communication and engagement with even greater potential than has currently been realised.},

	abstract = {A long-standing hypothesis in ecology and evolution is that trichromatic colour vision (the ability to distinguish red from green) in frugivorous primates has evolved as an adaptation to detect conspicuous (reddish) fruits. This could provide a competitive advantage over dichromatic frugivores which cannot distinguish reddish colours from a background of green foliage. Here, we test whether the origin, distribution and diversity of trichromatic primates is positively associated with the availability of conspicuous palm fruits, i.e. keystone fruit resources for tropical frugivores. We combine global data of colour vision, distribution and phylogenetic data for more than 400 primate species with fruit colour data for more than 1700 palm species, and reveal that species richness of trichromatic primates increases with the proportion of palm species that have conspicuous fruits, especially in subtropical African forests. By contrast, species richness of trichromats in Asia and the Americas is not positively associated with conspicuous palm fruit colours. Macroevolutionary analyses further indicate rapid and synchronous radiations of trichromats and conspicuous palms on the African mainland starting 10 Ma. These results suggest that the distribution and diversification of African trichromatic primates is strongly linked to the relative availability of conspicuous (versus non-conspicuous) palm fruits, and that interactions between primates and palms are related to the coevolutionary dynamics of primate colour vision systems and palm fruit colours.},
